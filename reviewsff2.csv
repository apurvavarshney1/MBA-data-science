"Big number game,not at all reasonable prices and the worst part is all the discounts they offer through credit card is just fake,before you pay it shows cant proceds right now.But without discount it really works good. Please dont fall into the trap,I suggest u better order it from your nearby store. On veggies and hand packed items they tag double price and then offer discount. No transparency at all.. worst experience",1,80
"Cheating through cancelation charges , while go through payment , at that time automatically order placing but no payment option. If you cancel as payment not over then RS 30. What's this nonsense, paying huge amount to celebrity but you will cheat customer.",1,1
Why does big basket bring about such an update wherein all the slots are now showing as full. Previously the slots were available and now after recent update all slots are full. This is such a frustrating thing.,1,48
Really irritating app.. Daily receiving msgs and mail from this app . But if I login into this app it shows ALL SLOTS ARE FULL . TRY AGAIN LATER. Really disgusting app. Experiencing this issue since may month . Not yet resolved,1,11
"Everytime i proceed to checkout, card payment fails and the cart starts showing zero products. Have to select all items again, and finally leading to the same error. Very irritating.",1,8
"It is disgusting the tricks they are using. Since paying for the membership slots are now 6am - 1030 pm! While non member accounts have the usual 2hr slot options at mid day time the same day. That too two days later, despite membership. My slot was then said to have changed to 7-9pm! the evening before. Quality of the fruits and veggies is an issue each time. Got completely rotten fruits and half rotten veggies thrice. Very odd feature of not updating out of stock items in the basket causing inconvenience when you want to pay.",1,73
"This app is really irritating, I am a bb star member by paying certain amount, they launched a new system where you need to get the token and when your number comes you can order, now the catch is when you want to order something you need to wait for your turn and when your turn come half of the products are out of stock. Moreover once you collect the token it takes almost 2 days for your number to come. Have nothing more to say apart for good bye big basket, you just lost one of your customer.",1,192
Content in app is not loading up.... I did my phone restart and network reset and checked my network speed as well but content inside your application keeps on loading and I am not able to order anything because of this. I checked my internet connection and its working fine and all other apps in my phone working fine as well,1,0
"If payment fails or customer changes his mind, they convert the order in COD. Now they have started outright cheating. If payment fails and you retry the payment then they deduct approx. 5% more from the order value. If your payment is successful in fourth attempt, then you end up paying 20% more on your order value. This extra 20 percent is penalty for purchasing from BigBasket.",1,5
"After adding products to basket, when I went to checkout page and returned back to add modify items, all items disappeared and I had to add them all back. Also I was facing issues when adding the items second time as it was showing at item page as already added but not able to see in the basket. Had to reinstall the application to place the order. Very bad user experience.",1,20
"App is absolutely glitchy and problematic, even if you try and give a good service from the logistics side, if the the app is so useless how is one gonna use your service?",1,0
"Very bad application, I was adding product but application is not into card, after addition many products check is out empty. What rubies",1,2
"It's been a month, I am trying to checkout with products in cart, showing slot on home page but it always shows ""No slots available, please try again later"" on checkout and this is really been two months now same thing. Really disappointing when you really need to order in such situations. Even though you are bb star member, it doesn't help. The situation is still the same in every lockdown, I am not sure why they are not fixing this issue.",1,288
"I wouldn't recommend it to anyone. Totally waste of time to using this app. All the time, slot is unavailable. Really appreciate the competitors are doing their best in this critical time. I suggest you to improve the availability method. In terms of price, it's very high.",1,2
"Don't trust this app, when the.money gets debited from account and further to it the bank too confirms payment is successful. BB say payment not received. Very problematic APP, not reliable for payment. They further call back asking us to pay again. Big basket is very greedy, poor customer experience. And also products are expensive when compared to market and competition. I had opted for bigbasket based on my convenience. Don't be loyal customer. It is not big basket but bug basket.",1,5
"What is the problem with it nowdays , it won't let me add anything more than 2 items . Can someone from your team connect to me. Even I have already reinstalled this application twice .",1,2
"No slots available (since April). I first thought it's a application issue, but many BB users are facing this same issue. App's homepage clearly shows next slot timings but at the time of Ordering it gives error 'No slots available for you'. I have complaint BB but no resolution to it. Since Govt allowed home deliveries, i have tried multiple times. It's July end still the same. Uninstalling it.",1,121
It won't show selected items in the cart and if it shows in the basket we cannot delete an item from basket.,1,1
I had absolutely no issues with this app. I understood when slots were unavailable during lockdown at first. Then slowly the operation became smoother but now for some unknown reasons slots are never available. In the past two weeks I haven't managed to book a slot even once. I do not understand what happened.,1,36
"It's been about 2 to 3 months that I am trying to shop from this app but it is always showing 'slots full, please try again later'. This is a very bad online shopping app. Also, there is no option of pay on delivery. Other apps are way better than this, atleast there are always free slots available. Here, I can never find a slot available so that I can order groceries. It is a very bad app.",1,40
Worst app ever found. Always shows all slot full. The people who are installing this app are simply wasting because you can't buy anything because even if the slots are empty it will show you the slots are full. It is just waste of time. The people who are installing this app with belief that they will get their groceries they are just wasting their time because the time where they could spend in this worst big basket they could find any other app. Recommended never install this app.,1,63
"Very poor app and customer service also. No time slot value and nither response properly. And customer support response:- ""Deliver guarantee is not applicable"".",1,6
"You deserve it. First they say your membership will be auto renewed in next five days and when you go to cancel the auto renewal, the app says some error has occurred. What do guys think that now I should add a reminder or call your customer service just to cancel that auto renewal?? Don't you think time is precious for everyone? Why one should spend their half an hour on something which they never asked for in the first place?",1,41
"Menus are loading very slowly, reinstalled app, but still the problem persists",1,0
"Pathetic, they don't allow changing phone number. In my present region, I am using a different number. I accidentally created a new account for my present number. My goal is to have one single account with my present email and present phone number. Now I can't do so since there is one account with my email and old phone number and a separate account for my new phone number. The customer care is so illiterate that they could not understand the issue even upon multiple calls. Finally quitting !!!",1,258
"Now no option to cancel bbstar membership also!!! Lost trust! You took Star membership fee and stopped services in my area!! Your customer care do not know when you will resume!! in new year you just complicated bank offers, introduced bbstar but made it useless by allowing eithee bank or bbstar coupon at a time. overall image decreased!!",1,1
"Unable to check cart with error ""sorry something broke from our end"". The error continues from 2 months unable to order anything.",1,2
Unable to remove items from basket. Shows removed but doesn't get removed.,1,0
Since March it shows slots are currently full. It's ridiculous. It could at least gv correct error that they are not currently delivering. I undated app too. No change. What's the point in sending new product and offer notification then? Just irritating and wast of space. I used to regularly order from bb. But today I will uninstall.,1,13
"Worst experience i had with this app , epitome of cheating, they will show you some price but ultimately impose 3 times the price of shown items, half the items are missing after cheatout(the cheaper ones) and the costlier varieties are imposed with 3 times the price, since everything is prepaid the money is now in wallet. Lockdown has actually taught everuone to cheat blatantly. I called up the number provided, they didn't inform anythng to this matter. I wish to give a negative rating",1,12
"Update 1- Third class app. not able to pay by debit card. i tried more than 5 times. I tried by different mobile but I couldn't pay. Update 2-(After 1 day). Iretried to pay atleast 15 times, but everytime transaction got failed. no one is replying over email. over chat issue escalated but noone is replying. I will never buy from bigbasket worst service. Updt 3- as you responded to this review I have shared my contact details to you... Update 4- shared order details. Updt 5- no solution yet.",1,15
"I had uninstalled the app as no slots were available continuously for two months or so, and when i installed it today ,instead of accepting my profile with my mail id,it was showing mail already exists.There should be a means of authentication of the user by sending a otp to registered mail.But it is always prompting me to give another mail id .Uninstalling the app again",1,7
Very waste app.Expired data products are coming.very waste of time and waster than any app in the world. Because of this app my stomach was not good for a half day. This app is danger than corona virus.this app is a extra virus in my phone.Never ever in my life up-to it updates till that time I will just not install this big big basket in my phone.so guys don't even try to order anything.If you order fruits and vegetables that will be rotten or having fungus or overripinned.waste waste waste.,1,5
"Last time I complained about availability of slot. So they come up with a good solution. They always show you Hard coded available slot and after putting so many efforts at the time of placing order *Sorry we don't have Slot"".. nice",1,1
"Not so good, Each order will definitely have some undelivered items. This happened to me each time I place order. The refund money will be added to your wallet only, but not to the original payment source. I have that refund money in my wallet but I'm not going to use this app because again I need pay delivery charges. This seems like gimmick.",1,9
"Big mess if you depend/trust them. I used to try for infinite time to get a delivery slot. Once got a slot, ordered vegetables and fruits. On the day of delivery received an email mentioning almost half of the items will not be delivered but order details in portal was not updated!!! But all items were delivered. Then the worst story, which is enough not to trust this brand. Most of the vegetables were rotted and frozen. Quality and service should come first then the rest.",1,4
"There seems to be a bug in the application I add items When I go to checkout, it shows an empty cart. If I go back and again add items, the item count goes up by 1. Showing count as 2 quantities now. I'm unable to place any order. My app is updated as well",1,5
Very bad app..... I don't accept my order due to some personal problems 14 days ago but till now they don't refund my money...I try again and again to contact them but no one receive any call . In this pandemic moment where money is a big problem but they continuously dribbling with me . This is very very bad .. now I decide to complain against bigbasket in consumer forum.... I want my money back as early as possible.,1,1
The worst!! From last four to five months they are unable to provide a single slot for me.. And bb prime membership is a scam. They dont give any excess facilities. Not even discounts on necessary items. And now they automatically renewed my membership and charged from my wallet. And now my wallet is showing minus balance. And from last few days i m trying to opt out of this auto renewed membership but this app is showing error and error.. Disgusting experience.,1,11
"The app stopped working for me in Android. I can use it only once. Every time i need to uninstall and install again. Technically i have tried all options like clearing cache, force stop restart etc. This issue is funny and facing since last 2 months. Earlier it was working fine.",1,9
"My experience, especially since March 2020, is very bad with them. Evry time I order, at time of delivery some item is not there. And refund is credited to BB wallet. This should not happen n an option should be within App to get the money back in the original source Account.",1,5
This is a paid members only app.. if u dont buy their membership plans u wont get any delivery slot. Uninstalling for 2nd time as i had installed this app after lockdown with a thought that probably now there wud be delivery slots available but even after 1 month couldn't find a single day with available slots.. money minded app n organisation.,1,8
worst experience with this app.Delivery slots are never available.cc is like robot .dont have any answers and least bothered.i have bbstar membership but never get a slot even though it shows slot availble at the home page.Half of the items added to cart will show not available after adding them.few of the items from the ordered items will go missing and they provide a cashback to bb wallet which can be used in next purchase.why cant they return the money to my wallet or card.,1,1
Giving 1 star just to find solution for notifications issue. There is no option to disable notification on available product. Opted to notify option for out of stock products but once available I purchased but still getting notification via email and app every time products are available so annoying. Please solve this issue or let me know how to disable,1,4
"All is well except ,Out of stock item gets back in stock and out of stock in a flash. And the out of stock item is not shown in the cart as well. And the Second problem is the payment gateway.I have tried each and every payment option for discount but I haven't succed Even once , I mean almost every time the payment gateway is broke and even after successfully applying the voucher the order gets shifted to cod and you have to pay full price and after this if you try to apply vouch. Its waste😠",1,6
"I m a old customer, but now a days the app behaving like stranger, showing all the slots are full. it may be for a sort of time, but in every single time having the same Worst Experience. Truly getting Fed up by seeing the same thing !! :@",1,4
"Orders get cancelled without notification. They won't refund shipping charges unless asked. When you contact customer support, they just repeat the pre-framed blurbs without explaining the actual issue which is quite irritating.",1,0
"The sodexo, though being a contact less payment medium is unavailable alongside cash on delivery. This shows how little of effort goes into the development as there is no underlying knowledge how a payment method works. Since sodexo meal card is similar to any other debit/credit card in terms of making payment, I don't see a reason why anyone logically would disable it under the Covid distress. While the competing online grocery store readily accepts sodexo card.",1,3
Worst app ever. Doesn't give slots for long time now and we are facing problems due to this. Even customer care is very poor and don't solve any problem just makes you roam in circles.,1,5
"For the name sake of bb membership, they won't give you any slot but if you are non bb member then you can place order successfully. Priority slot mean bb is making you fool because you never get this slot as per my experience but if you are non member then you successfully get slot.",1,3
"Slots are never available, irrespective of normal or BBSTAR members. We understand that there is a crisis, but this is getting very frustrating. Like slots are never available!",1,4
"There is a trick while applying coupon code, big basket not allowing customer to apply coupons. It happen to me everytime when i try to apply code, they failed the payment and while I try to revise payment it says i can not apply this code. It is very frustrating. 2nd issue is always there is some item missing in every order.",1,10
Kindly label the images present in app As Google TalkBack is not able to identify it hence visually impaired are facing difficulties to use BigBasket app,1,7
"Pathetic experience using Simpl wallet hosted on big basket. Amount gets deducted from Simpl but big basket denies that any payment happened. Huhhh...,, The customer care is so illiterate, they read out your problem and ask the same question you mentioned in the problem statement. It took me 10 days of pursuit to explain the problem and still no solution. Eveybtime they say that they are escalating it be looking into it. please improve the customer service experience or lose customer's",1,2
"Many payment incidents while paying by card, despite bank confirmation of payment, bigbasket refuses to acknowledge payment completion nor has big basket's escalation team respond this matter. Very disappointing!!",1,1
"This is regarding you poor services and application. 1. Your app doesn't catch my location and automatically shows wrong address. 2. Past 1 month the is no delivery slot available 3. Despite entering my location of east delhi, everytime I login it goes to banglore location. 4. When i choose option notify me when the product is available it sends me the message for the product available at banglore location and not for my address Delhi What kind of services you offer?",1,2
App shows that there are slots available but while checkout I get slots not available message. Trying to checkout from long time. I even went and checked delivery slot against each product as well. Such a waste of time of adding the products and then again waste trying to order in regular intervals. Frustrated user.,1,4
This app needs to have better inventory validation. Most of the time the items ordered are less than the items received. I think it is basic functionality for CXP.,1,0
"Used to work great, but the latest app is not letting me load even the home page on my Mi A3. The loading occurs infintely. Please fix this issue!",1,0
"A worst app, they have not refunded the amount for which they have not delivered if I enquire they said it's been initiated , but I have not recieved any amount , they are not responding properly. It's just a waste of time and money.",1,0
One of the worst app after the lockdown started. When you enter the app it shows that you have delivery slot available and you add all the items and then click on checkout and then it says we don't have delivery slot available for your location but when I check at home page it still says delivery slot available. If that is the case you should let us know at the start since my address is saved in the app. And last mnth it made me purchase the worst BB star prgrm and since then Im facing this prob,1,3
"App shows available slots on home screen but while placing order app gives error 'No slot available'. It seems like company is playing with customers to keep them engage on platform,even though they dont have capacity to serve orders.",1,0
"This is a very cheap app, case of fraud on such an app. After the transaction, when it is canceled at the time of delivery, saying that your boundary falls outside the area. And your money will come in 7 to 9 working days.",1,1
The app and its service are good but there is some problem in the app i have created my profile on the app but still it was asking me to create the profile and at the time of email id it was showing that i have alredy used the email id . Please do solve this problem because of that i had faced problem in placing order.,1,5
My big basket app always show Bangalore location while I reside in Hyderabad. I have set my default address in Hyderabad and don't have a Bangalore address still it gets reset to Bangalore by itself which is quite irritating. Most of the items are out of stock all the time.,1,2
Pathetic service It shows slot is available. Have been calling the customer care since past 3 months and they say it's a technical glitch. They haven't solved the issue till date and my membership is getting wasted. Absolutely pathetic,1,0
Some items shows as available and packing time change to not available. When i checked the same product at the time of delivery it shows still as available. Don't cheat by showing as available. Otherwise return amount should give back to the account from where it paid. Do not keep with you by saying its in our wallet.,1,0
Unable to proceed to payment screen. Presently confirming order over phone. Only fund wallet option is working for my phone. 6.8.2020 Sent required screen shot. Updated to latest version of your app. Still app not working.,1,5
"Good for ordering first couple of times only. Offers are not good, only an item or two will be showed in discount and rest are overpriced more than what we get in our local stores, range of products is poor, stock is always low{specially vegetables}, few of the common items are not even available like burger buns, wipped cream etc. Cannot use for longer period. I am there bb star member even after that i face these problems.",1,0
"Could not order the entire day and every time it shows slots are unavailable. When I logout it is showing slots are available for the location I have provided, but in logging in the slots are not showing at all. I am even a bbstar member. For what I have paid you extra money then if you cannot provide me a slot for two days later ?",1,0
"App doesn't accept virtual meal pass by Sodexo, errors as invalid card number.",1,0
Wallet amount can't be reversed back to source account without cx support's help. Also once payment is through and if you try to apply voucher it asks to make payment again of discounted amount and cancels the initial payment made. Cx support is also not upto the mark.,1,2
This app is really irritating I've used payzapp option and it was mentioned use code GROCERY on payzapp and while proceeding to payment there was nothing to input the code then I came back on the order page now they are saying order placed but I don't have cash to pay them and now they want cash,1,0
"Very less items are available and at high cost , payment gateway is bad. Once the items runs out of stock it will take many days to restock again. After opting payment option order will place without deduction of money and it will automatically turn into COD. Plz improve it .",1,1
I paid from my bank account and I expect refund in my bank account. They never mentioned they will refund in store credits. On top of that I cannot use it unless I spend more than what I have in terms of store credits. Stay away.,1,2
They've completely lost the plot. How's the inventory management so bad. - Go through the Suck navigation and discovery. Hit the checkout button. And boom! 11 of the 25 items on your list are not available. - Order the remaining. Expect to get only half of them. If you're lucky. And they'll inform only an hour before delviery.,1,5
There is no point in continuing your services if you could not provide slots to customers. Since the last three months i have been trying to get a slot but failed to do so. You could not even provide slots 1 week down the line also!!!,1,3
"One of the biggest problem with this App is, paying thru Sodexo card option is not available in it. Whilst I understand cash on delivery is deterrent towards contactless delivery, would like to sincerely request on to look for reintroducing the option of paying thru Sodexo in the App itself.",1,4
"If there is an option to give no star, I will prefer that. Just worst service. Since last 6 days there is no slots available for delivery. After subscribing the BB Star membership there was also the same. Now there is many alternatives. So why would we depend on you.",1,3
Pathetic condition of the app.... First of all trying for a long time but no slot availability n now the order items are not even displaying in the basket... Have been on it for an hour still the same thing. Grofers is much better... 😠😠😠😡😡,1,4
Such a pathetic app never get the available slot to make booking. Slot was available while products were added on to the cart but while placing the order it shows no slot available.. its really frustrating.. grofers is 100 times better then this in terms of service and discounts,1,5
I paid and taken membership. But there is no use with the membership. Simply wast of money. Better dont take the membership. There is no response from customer care also. Asked them to cancle my membeeship within 10 days from the daye of puarchase. But i did not get any rsponse.,1,0
"They were mentioning that slot is available for the particular address, however after ordering the message is populating as no slots. It is very disgusting and wasting of precious time during these days.",1,1
If you have no slot available for delivery ... Why are you not showing it in very beginning??? . Getting to know after adding all required items in basket is very irritating. Please work on it.,1,0
"No slot for last four month. Why you mention slot is full, if you are not working. Mention the next available slot. Getting highly better service from other delivery app.",1,4
"For the last 3 months,I have seen only one message,""All slots full"",every single time,absolutely disappointing experience.",1,1
"This app showing initailly discounted price, while check out adjusted higher amount, really bad experaince i had. Only software engineer and high pay professionals are dont worry about thier money, they usually wont check such mistske.. but really a cheating and bloody aapp.. Rice 10 kg 490 discounted price but check out it become 650 rs, urad dal 151 rs during adding card after check out it become 220 rs... guys be carefull... such a worst and cheating organisation..",1,3
"This app should be named as ""no slot available"" app no matter how much you try the slots are always booked. Yet the irony is there is a membership also with fees which dosent helps.",1,2
"The only time I got a slot is on the day I bought the membership, its been more than 3 months now and I wondering when I will be able to get a slot... Very disappointed!!",1,5
If you select 5 items you will get only 2 items from the list and if you going to purchase again that remaining item then delivery charges will apply on you again on the same item... Totally rubbish,1,0
Very bad service every time i try to place order it says that all slots are full please try again later. I have to order esssentials.please fix this problem as soon as possible.,1,4
Very bad experience with big basket. 92% of the time you will not be able to order due to slot not available message. Guys I would like to know if you will keep on waiting for next 10-12 days when you are running out of groceries and supply. Don't get fooled by their bbstar membership it is useless and doesn't guarantee any better service. Their customer service is equally bad and apathetic.,1,4
"Worst experience ever with this app placed an order but payment methods are not working but the order is place. Want to pay from order my ac option but payment button not highlights. Want to cancel the order but keep saying ""error at there end engineers are working on it keep trying after some time"" I will not give one star for this app but there is no lower options in google store rating. Very disappointed buy there service",1,3
It shows no slots available...it has been more than 10 days. I don't understand what is wrong. It's better to uninstall rather than waiting for available slot.,1,3
"Worst app, been trying to set up an account and I have tried maybe about 10 times since yesterday and it still won't send an OTP to verify my mobile number.",1,1
"It's showing- slots are full, try again later. It's continuing from long period. What's the utility of this app if customers are not able to place orders .",1,3
"The bbstar membership is a sadistic joke. Some of my family members tested COVID positive, and I bought the membership so that they could get essential items quickly. They advertise saying that there are special slots for star members, but I can only get groceries delivered 5-6 days later, with the membership. What is the point of that? JioMart and Amazon pantry have shorter delivery times, and you don't even have to pay extra fees for a farce called ""star membership"". Utterly disappointed.",1,1
"Worse! Why this app still there don't know! They don't want to do business! Trying last 4-5 days! Always shows ""All slots are full! I would give zero star. Grofers, Amazon, swiggy, jio mart much much better.",1,4
The items are not showing in tbe cart. Only after log off and login again I was able to see the cart items. And Now I am not able to remove anything from the cart. Seeing the issue from last 2 days. :(,1,0

"I have ordered so many times from bigbasket and yes I have got everytime as per schedule, with quality issues sometimes..but that was acceptable and bigbasket also never denied replacing that too. But for almost a month it is showing slotts available but instead to BB star I do not get my items schedule to my location.. How the hell bigbasket not capable of delivering the items. Whereas grofers do. For last one one month I had ordered 4 times from grofers and this BB is showing no slots availabl",1,0
"Can not pay through Sodexo. Due to covid they have disabled sodexo at delivery, that is fine but there should be an option of paying through sodexo card by entering card number digitally at the time of check out itself.",1,1
You guys have the worst app service... I told the customer care person to delete my mobile number so that i can use that mobile number to my email address account. That guy informed that mobile number account is disabled and even after 3-4 days im not able to still use that mobile number to my account.,1,3
"Cheated by bbstar membership, dont purchase. There is no slot. After bbstar membership given 1 delivery then no slot and no response from support. Support saying they fix as earliest, no knowledge of when fix in non containment zone.",1,0
I cannot install this latest version and I have cleared the storage space and also restarted my phone several times.,1,0
The app should allow for prepayments using Sodexo cards just like you would do using a normal credit/debit card. Treating Sodexo only as a CoD option is inconvenient and that too is disabled during the current covid crisis.,1,2
What is the neeed of this app when there are no slots available at crucial times??? A friend in neeed is a friend indeed. But this proverb does not go with Big basket. Very dissatisfied.,1,0
"This issue happens more than 10 times till now.If you place order for ex: 10 items and while delivering they mention 4 to 5 items not available. If items are not available why in the first place bigbasket allowing me to place order.After delivery when I opened the app the item is availabe ,so to re order In big basket atleast I should buy items for 600rs to opt free delivery which is nonsense. So to buy remaining items I have to choose other apps. I never faced the issue with other grocery apps",1,2
"Today I had my worst experience with Bigbasket. After adding 11 items, when I tried to pay, I got a message ""something wrong happened from our end"". After that all the items in basket emptied. I had enter all the items AGAIN. Again it failed during payment. WORST ONLINE SHOPPING EXPERIENCE",1,2
"My first experience with this app is worst experience of my life as I also have the bb star membership. AT the time of delivery they told me to deliver the order on next day, then why we need the membership as it seems to be the wastage of money.",1,1
"All time showing no slot available. This is not big busket, like small busket. Pls change your app name big busket to small busket. Very disappointed. How many years waiting for available of slot ?????",1,2
Every time they are skipping one item and crediting refund to Big basket wallet. It should be reverted to the actual payment method what i have used at the time of purchase.,1,0
Very poor service good for nothing app they serve products which are expired to the customers there are many other good apps then big basket. Overall Review:- Miserable App I would not recommend this app to anyone who is very keen in ordering good quality of grocery for home purposes.,1,0

"After the most recent update with some token system, I'm not able to place order despite being a star member. Called up customer support and no luck with the issue. Frustrating experience to order groceries :(",1,2
"From last 2 month whenever we add any products to cart it got deleted automatically, earlier I thought might be it is some temporary error. Now I feel it is some major issue. Now I'm shopping at Amazon pantry they are providing very good service.",1,2
Everytime I visit the app it keeps showing all slots full. Totally disappointed. This is happening since april. Now uninstalling the app. Useless!,1,1
BigBasket has been nothing but a horrible experience with incompetent customer service giving generic answers to almost anything you ask them. The slots are almost never available even if you are a so called BB Star Member. 399 for this stupid membership which puts you in the same place as without it. Priority slots for members is a complete joke! The overall service has deteriorated from bad to worse. Its frustrating when you are not given the service you're promised in the first place.,1,3
Please remove all the bugs in the app. There comes a white screen at the payment page.,1,0
Not able to pay online after otp.. payment got failed. And i received msg from bank that money got deducted. App showing cod.... After some time i retried money got deducted again from bank...but app is showing payment failed...means you deducted 2 times and still showing cod,1,7
There never are slots available. Come on guys. Can't you invest in some system where slots are automatically allocated depending on staff availability?!? So broke?!? If the available slots are not convenient customer will leave and shop elsewhere. Simple.,1,0
"Prices of items on bigbasket Onion 1kg = 22 Potato 1kg = 42 Tomato 1kg = 38 Total = 102 Combo pack of 1kg onion + 1kg potato + 1kg Tomato = 118 Amazing pricing model, I had uninstalled you for thr right reasons 😂, it was a waste to of time installing you again, hoping something would have changed 🙄",1,1

"Shameful, again advanced paid order not delivered. Pathetic, no stock of essential items. Due to silly slot issues, were unable to book order for 3 weeks. Then after order with advance payment, full order got cancelled after failing to deliver. Had to call for refund to account, and was advised 7-10 days waiting period. Stop taking advance from customers with orders, if you are unable to deliver. You should pack up your business, if you are unable to fulfill confirmed paid orders.",1,0
This app is of no use..... There r no freaking slots available..... Only the ones who have taken bbstar membership hv the slots available not us the ones who hv not taken. If u wanted to keep it so then why even keep it without of the membership.,1,0
Been 3 months now. Still no delivery slot for my area. Just a useless service. Removing it. Will see if bug basket is functioning when a vaccine is available worldwide.,1,3
Worst app ever. Slots are not available for a single time too. I m trying since 3 days still I m not getting a single slot. Bad experience.,1,0
"The experience is pathetic and customer service is horrible.1.The amount refunded should be back to the original payment method and not force customers to come back. 2. No matter how fast you cancel ,5 mins or 5 seconds,you will be charged cancellation fee. 3. The online transaction fails if you apply a voucher and you end up paying cash. 4.Customer service is useless, they do not understand the issue/query,and doesn't know difference bw UPI and entering card details through debit/credit card.",1,0
"After taking BB star membership also no slots since last 14 days at any time. And I was surprised to know, new customer in my building have got slots and received delivery in 1 day! Why this differential approach to customers? If operational issues, I guess that will be for everyone in that location.",1,0
Well it's already 7 days. But I don't get any slots. Is it broke? Are not you guys gonna fix it? How much wait I have to do? Or It will be one month and the slots are still full.,1,2

"Worst app earlier use to really good, delivered product r really bad condition if Play Store allowed photo i would have clicked it and shared it. Moreover when you place a order firstly it will get confirmed all the item , later at time of delivery they will this and that item are not there since you have prepaid it m, hence the balance get stuck at their wallet. Rather I have started using JIO MART which is far superior than Big Basket plus no delivery charge at all even if you purchase for ₹20",1,2
"Serious problem with the app, my neighbors next door can get groceries delivered but for me it shows not in serviceable area. BB team should take this seriously. Never going to use this app in future",1,1

"Cheap tricks. All items are added to cart and payment is made but suddenly some of these items will not be delivered. The refund will go to wallet and now you have to spend again to clear the wallet. Pathetic and out of touch marketing. Even when I order just three items and one didn't deliver. The delivery is also very messy, they treat the products like luggage in airport checkout. Same problem in the browser. I'll give zero if I can🤬",1,2
Poor service they always cancel orders after completing payments and they didn't refund money in bank account and if we trying to transfer the amount of bigbasket wallet to bank account this process is not working. 😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡,1,1
"The worst app of shopping. Don't install.... Amazon is best one to order any thing. They are not deliver bulk order if you want. They have cancelled my order telling that, i am ordered the item for commercial purposes, that is a biggest mistake of big basket. And they have deactivated my account. ..so friends don't install it... If there is any option of zero star... then i will give zero",1,0
Always slot full. If you can't even buy anything then what's the use of this app. Grofers is far better.,1,0
Initially the experience was good. But once I had paid for membership the service has ruined. The delivery is getting delayed everytime. There executive left the conversation in between without clearing your concerns. Not recommended at all .,1,1

"What is the point of having tokens for slots if I can't place an order on the date mentioned. My token dates keep on shifting. You have no desire to improve your delivery systems, if I face these issues living in a metro city then I can only imagine what people face in small cities. I'm fast losing my patience and will uninstall the app soon if service is so bad. Additionally I will request everyone I know to refrain from using bigbasket if this goes on.",1,102
Fraudulent refund policy. Items always out of stock The app lets you place orders for items that always go out of stock. The refund always goes back to bb wallet and not to the original mode of payment which is an outright fraud. I have availed their membership as well. But no benefits. Recommend to use amazon or grofers rather than this,1,2

"Horrible service.Many frozen items are spoilt.I've been cheated by this service a number of times.Product availability is not mentioned before booking.Amount is collected for all the items.At the time of delivery, the delivery guy tells us that the items are not available and that the amount will be credited to the wallet When I insisted that I get a refund,they said that it was sent to the bank.Till date I have neither received the amount in my bank nor in mywallet.Customer service is hopeless",1,0

Leave aside slots which are always full even if you are lucky enough to get one they change the slots in their own will and then lie about it. Also got delivery of rotten items,1,1
Worst app i have placed a order on 11th may 2020 and that order got cancelled automatically on 14th may 2020 for which I still didn't received my refund.

"I am going nuts. While applying voucher, if voucher is not applicable becoz of certain products,pls tell so that we can alter/remove products. instead the app goes ahead with payment and then fails.

"Why do products show available status and can be added and ordered but then eventually the money is returned to the wallet because the product was out of stock in the first place?

Beware! Every time I order something they cancel 2 or 3 items and credit the amount to big basket wallet instead of refunding to the original payment method.

Time and time again I have noticed this strategy and tactic of items being not available at the time of delivery but these were failed to be notified as out of stock while purchasing. Only to push the refund towards the BB wallet and create future opportunity to continue placing orders by utilizing BB wallet. You guys have not learnt from the feedback given in the past and I have decided to discontinue your service.,1,0
I used to love big basket but it is actually worthless whenever we try to order anything its shows all slots full its happening since march i bought a lot of stuff from grofers today again i tried to order few stuff again its showing slot full just right after checkout..if u can't deliver the products at the right time what's the use of the app then? I guess will stick to grofers only atleast they deliver the product at right time although they dont have variety of products like bb,1,0

Now a days big basket has started new things for every item they give you less quantity. Example if I order 1 kg they will modify the bill sayin 1.02kg was delivered but in actual you will receive 960gm only (including packing). So they are delivering almost 50gm lesser quantity for each product. Either they should not modify the quantity at all or they should charge for correct quantity,1,2

Worst app i strongly suggest not to place the order from this app. I have placed order 2 times of the same product but the company automatically cancels the order on the date in which product is to be delivered and also does not refund the whole amount.

Not even eligible for single star. I had a very bad experience with bigbasket. They are not fully equipped and ready to support massive online requests * Even calling customer care service also was not helpful * Initially he asked me to cancel the order and start over with same.

My experience was better with big basket in past. I got my order at least 3-4hrs late despite there was no comlensation given by big basket .i guess customers are getting more impacted then bigbasket as business is normal for them .but there was no understanding from bigbasket. I guess it ia tome to go with jio mart or grofers or any other,1,0
Useless rules of applying vouchers. I applied voucher and some amount was paid from wallet as some items were cancelled last time and amount was credited to wallet. For some reason the card transaction failed but the order got placed and wallet amount was deducted. Now when I am trying to pay through the card it is not allowing to apply the voucher though the amount is well above minimum amount applicable. Useless rules to deny applying vouchers. Refund to cards instead of wallet.,1,0

You literally don't get a slot ! It always shows Slots unavailable. The app UI is pretty good but what's point if you can't order. Had to Use another app called ( Grofers) and they did a pretty good job . Anyone facing the same issue with this app can try the one I mentioned above. Please BB customer service should look into this and try to resolve it ASAP. Other than that this app is probably the best in terms of UI in comparison to other Online grocery apps.,1,36
"I posted a review before a couple of months back that it always shows ""no slots available"" Even after few months , its the same... It still always shows "" No slots available""...

"Most disappointing experience, feel harrassed because your payment gateway does not work, thus causing extreme inconvenience to the customer, particularly during Covid times, a company like yours should make sure that you give smooth and seamless service to your customers.

I have lost out on buying so many things and so many times. Gets frustrating. If it frustrates me then it is not having a positive impact on my life. Isn't it?",1,85
User interface for placing an order is pathetic. Slots are almost never available and the customer is just expected to continuously check the app for slot availability as if that's our only job. Why cant you take the order and deliver whenever there's an available slot next like all other better ecommerce platforms. There is room for a lot of imrovement. Not listening to voice of the customer will ultimately bring your downfall. Secondly you removed sodexo card as payment mode for unknown reason,1,0
No Option to Pay with Zeta. I already updated my app and still it says as a precautionary measure we stopped accepting Sodexo and Zeta. If I am paying online. What precatuions you are expecting ??,1,2

Will uninstall as soon as my account gets refunded.,1,8
It has been more than 2 months now that no slot is available despite being shown on the homepage. It is disappointing to see that such a big banner is failing to provide delivery while other online platforms are carrying out deliveries so smoothly. A very below par service.,1,11
It is an incomplete application with loads of improvement required.1) It makes you pay for the product and the next day it will show items that u paid for and was available until u pay is now modified and cant be delivered. 2)It will then have that modified item amount added to its wallet from where we cannot transfer it to the source ourselves the customer care transfers it and plus to increase our trouble it takes 5 to 7 business days to get it back to source. 3) The customer service pathetic.,1,32

Its a humble request please solve it, you guys know the best",1,28
Like others my review is also somewhat similar. Getting a slot is a big task for non bb members.And yes even if you get a slot the items which you have selected at the time of check out almost 70% items are not available. Worst app ever. Twice I have uninstalled this app.,1,2

It's been 3 weeks I'm trying to place an order but couldn't. Bigbasket have become useless for me when I needed it most. PS. You're asking me to share order details. How can I share order details when I can not place an order at first place and that's what the review is all about.,1,274
"There seems to be a big bug in this app at this moment, it shows slots available in the main page but as soon as I begin to checkout those items, the app all of a sudden shows no ""slots available please try again later"". This has been happening for quite a time now. It's more of a problem in these testing time. Please fix this issue as soon as possible.",1,98
My experience is worst with this app. Even they are showing the available slots while confirming always gets the error that no available slots available. Tried to deactivate the account but again very pathetic service 😤😤 that they don't bother to reply how to deactivate the account. Worst worst and worst ever services. Now not able to check the details also very bad 😣😣😣,1,10
After ordering most of the items are not getting delivered saying out of stock. Delay in delivery. Overall worst experience. First impression is the best impression. I'll not use and recommend same to others.,1,0
"On my main page 'next available slot' is showing standard date and time, but when I check out it is showing as 'we do not have any available slots to service you right now'. What stupidity is this. Some of the items is showing available, but when we go to check our cart the item would be removed saying as not available. Thought of trying this app for the first time, but I feel it is not up to the standards.",1,237
"The most thirdclass app. This apparently shows a very diverse product range. But they never ever have any availability. Every time you proceed to checkout, a message will be displayed that currently they don't have any slots.. But you still wasted god damn 15 mins searching items and adding to your cart. Bloody waste of time.. And then you hope lets keep it like that and try again later.. It gives the same bloody response again.",1,0
"Refunds will not go back to original payment mode, instead amount will be parked in wallet and need to do purchases. Also even payment fails then also order will be placed and need to pay in cash. All ways it is a trap.",1,3
"The worst app ever ! It takes me more than 20 mins to log in. Every single app works except this one, it started loading so I left my house and went down the street it took me half an hour and when I return it was still loading , I personally thought there was no internet and checked another apps and surprisingly every app worked except this one . I hope this feedback helps you",1,28
"Such a useless app. It's been more than a month now and I'm tired of waiting for this app to improve. Not of any use during times when people are depending on online delivery during lockdown. Slots are never available, items are shown while browsing but unavailable during checkout, there are no notifications regarding availability. There are much better apps out there so don't install this app. Uninstalling right away.",1,5
"I am very disappointed with your service, even after I made an online payment, even after that, my wrong address was written in my app and due to which I have not received my goods yet, money has been deducted from my account. I am correcting the address again and again but it is showing wrong again Really, your service is very bad, I have been harmed and nobody is helping me, you are very bad service. Disappointed",1,2
In this time of crisis they cant make Slots available. On their home page it shows slot available and gives you delivery date and time. But when you go to checkout they say no available slots. But the home page keeps showing slot available. This is ridiculous service of yours . For the last 2 months this is going on and no improvement.,1,2
If you busy 3 items we only get two and the other product amout will be added to big basket wallet. If you make another transaction delivery charges will be credited but you have to ask them and that amount will be added to your wallet and you will keep making transaction . No such customer service. worst service ever.,1,0
"Horrible experience. First you spend time finding the stuff you want to order. Half the stuff is out of stock. Their filter doesn't work. Then when you check out, no slots are available. When slots are available then half the stuff in your cart are still stocked out. I wish I can give this app.and their service zero stars",1,10
"Pathetic service. 😡 Taking hours to list the grocery I placed order and it accept my pin code and then next day I'm getting call from bigbasket, saying""due to technical issue we are unable to deliver to your location"" and refund it will take 7 to 10 days. 😡😡 because of there technical issue I have wait 10days😡 great.. Service.",1,0
"This app seems to be little funny.. When ever we open the app..pick up the item we want(which show available) and when we proceed to check out..Message pops out and say that ""Unfortunately we dont have any available slot to service you right now. Please try again later"" It is seems to be Big Basket is jst wasting time of the consumer.. During this lock down this kind of behavior is not accepted from a well know brand name "" Big Basket""..I will surely see to it I report the same on social media",1,23
Your service is not available every time & vegetable is not fresh,1,0
"Struggled for more than 3 hours; amount debited twice; App says payment failed and they cancelled the order finally. Amazing experience. So after their 'sincere apology', I dropped these guys a mail on that very day. And guess what, they couldn't take out time to reply to a f-ing mail, which they wanted to look 'right away' into. I'm editing this review after a week. Haam to ji mhaare parchoon aale ki dukaan pe te le aavange, thara App chutdy**n me de lio.",1,0
"Slots are never available. Sometimes it is but still says no available slots when I try to checkout my cart. Chat and call services have been deactivated. The app is supposed to work during these difficult times but it has been reduced to nothing. Under normal circumstances, people wouldn't bother but they fail to stand when their need is the most.",1,226
"Total disappointment when needed the most. Whats the use of an online service which can not manage it's orders. Tried whole month but every time all slots full. Improve your service guys. Uninstalled Edit: Since you have replies without accepting your mistake let me escalate this a bit, if u can't privide your service when needed the most, and taking the order without checking your inventory only to cancel it later, you are only adding stress to already stressed customers. Would give 0 stars.",1,0
"When I Started shopping it was showing me the available slot and now when I have ended up , sent me a pop up message that no slot is available and if go back to home page shows slot is available. What is this non sense. Wasted my efforts 😡",1,2
Items added to basket are not appearing. It always shows empty. After spending almost 15-20 mins realised that cart is always empty. Tried a number of times. Absolute waste of time. Very poor app.,1,3
"I was a happy customer and I understand that due to the current social situation slots are not readily available. But since few days, there are times when I can see slots available from my home page, but when I try to checkout to place an order, it says no slots available. I can still see that slots are available. This is more frustrating than actually slots being unavailable. Please look into this.",1,48
"Having shopped twice every month for almost 4-5 years, I expected Big basket to deliver in these trying times. But I never get a slot. If I get a slot by mistake, the things go out stock. I can understand the struggle in the initial few days but now it's been more than a month and I cannot get anything delivered. I guess it's back to your local kirana stores. I doubt I would order anything from big basket once the lockdown is over.",1,15
"Not functioning properly, only message is coming "" all slots are full, please try again later"". If the developer of this app can not serve people in emergency situation, then why people will use it during normal situation. reply of your ans- You are forgetting that you are dealing with essential food items, not fancy clothes or jewellery that people will show patience for longer to delivery. People can not stop taking food as your slot is not available!!!! I would never like to use it again!!!",1,14
"Shows slot available after a long time and then too doesn't goes to payment page. I understand If the slot is available after a long time but showing it and then also not been able to order is irritating.///// *Update* 29,30&31 may 20. The app team was very fast in replying but very slow in rectifying. The problem persists. Consecutively on 7th day, will keep updating status daily. Let's see if the team is capable of resolving it or not ////",1,165
"It's always the same message, ""Slots are full, please try again later"". If there are such problem try making a minimum order policy like everyone else is doing. I even bought their membership but it's of no use. I still can't order anything. In the homepage it shows that the slots are available but by the time you checkout there are none available. I mean common, stop allowing people to make small orders. Get a minimum order limit. This app sucks",1,53
"Very bad experience, no on time delivery and also delivery slot is changed this is very bad because this is essential service and all of this daily needs items, i will cancel the delivery slots customer service is saying amount is credited to my account in 7 working days but complete almost 10 days amount is not credited to my account",1,0
"Worst app and worst service as well. They will always show slot will be open tomorrow for your area and when you check back tomorrow they display (slot will be open tomorrow) and guess what you'll be stuck in this endless loop for forever and the only way to come out of it, is uninstall the worst app. Use Grofers, flipkart and Amazon at least you won't be stuck in endless loop. Edit - 1 - Dear developers please don't bother to write back that the issue was escalated and it'll be fixed.",1,11
"Bad app. I registered with my phone number and it didn't ask for my email when registering. When I added items and started to check out, it wanted my email address and other details. Apparently someone else has already registered my email address with another phone number, so there is no way for me to use the app. I cannot change anything since I assume OTP is sent to the other phone number which is not mine. Obviously, there is no e-mail address verification at the time of registering, else the other person could not have registered my email. Just very poor app design and authentication. Also it is possible to add items to your cart without registering. When trying to check out, it will ask you to register, and then promptly delete everything which is already in the cart. Needs some serious work and testing. Since there is no way to fix this, I have uninstalled this app.",1,73
Hopeless app.Everytime when I login it shows be the next days slot and when I check the next day it again shows me slot available for next day.....keeps on going in this loop....useless app in these times of need. Is the issue resolved or is it the same old story. seems like you guys are telling everyone the same stroy for the last one month.,1,1
"During the most critical times like the lockdown when the services of this app was the most required, this app and it's services turned out to be a total failure. It's almost the end of 21 days lockdown and they still couldn't find a way to accept orders or deliver. At least Amazon pantry delivered products. This is such a shame for this oldest homegrown service. Update: They still don't understand feedback. Starting 24th March they stopped accepting orders 😡 and couldn't provide services.",1,10
"Worst experience. This is not the first time. Every time I think I will not get any bad items next time. But it kept on happening. I have repeatedly been receiving bad quality product. Today when I checked the rating in Google play things got clear. I should not have installed this damn app at the first place. Ya I accept you have lot of variety ,but quantity is not going give you boost into your business, rather you look for the quality which could save you in future.",1,71
"One of the worst app for grocery shopping in this lockdown. There are no slots available at all times, I took a bbstar membership, still the same issue. Why dont you declare as not functional, when you cant serve customers.",1,2
One or less than one star for slot not being available when i need to shop . Useless app. Why do you even do business when you are not able to deliver products.,1,0
"After waiting for almost a week ,finally got the slot available notification pop up. As the list was already ready in cart ,tried to place the order and then it shows that there is no slot available. I can see the slot available notification on the menu tab but can't place the order . Tried contacting customer care multiple times but no use. Tried the chat option still no response even after waiting for more than 1hr. Such a worst service. Totally disappointed.",1,3
Such a bloody app. I am unable to select my address propely. Why can't I type my full address on my own? Why do I have to select via Google map. Disgusting. Google map is also not giving me proper adress. Huh....,1,1
No availability of slot even after membership,1,0
"Very very disgusting 1. Slots are not available for weeks together. 2. When they show the available slots, at the time of checking out, message flashes ""Slots not available 🙄🙄 3. After selection of items, at the time of checking out ""Items are not available"". Sheer waste of time and energy. Amazon still thousand times better. Not sure if we try and patronize home grown companies, how much they will disappoint and frustrate the clients",1,83
"An absolutely useless app. I spend around 20 mins ordering things on the app after seeing a standard slot available but when I check out it say slots unavailable. Then why are you showing standard slots available. It doesn't make any sense. I have had no operational issues with amazon, flipkart or groffers. It is just this crappy app having a herculean hurdle to make a single order. To my bad luck, I took the membership which is of no use.",1,49
"Instance 1 :- They take payment from us and then cancel booking at the last moment. Then they take 7-10 working days to refund. Sheer nonsense. Instance 2 :- Yet again, took order and payment 5 days back. They were supposed to deliver today and in the last minute they said they cant deliver and the refund would take another 8-10 days.",1,2
I have tried to place my first ever order which eventually got failed. But surprisingly the chat support people was giving someone else's order and wallet details whom I never know. I see a potential securty risk having it on mobile and order items through it as my details might be given to someone else. _________ Response to your comment: I would suggest to get in touch with chat support to know the exact issue in terms of the information that they have given to my question.,1,0
"With this lock down time I register to big basket to avail the required grocery and vegetables on priority as I am not able do that as everytime the app shows there is no available slots, even if available slot is displayed. Also in the app mentioned with bbstar membership will get priority slot than other customer and I registered also for it but it also didn't work out. I feel that I was cheated like anything. Have informed the team but of no use.",1,8
"Very bad services. In the time of need they are not providing good service, i would say not at all providing services. Lot of products are available, but no use. I have been trying for the past 20days. All the time slots are full or not available. Today i tried and got a slot fr 22/04/20. But when about to make payment again same message",1,1
"Just downloaded the app, first the slot availability is a mess, you are not notified when the next slot is available and you don't get the slot you desire. Secondly, the customer service is horrible, they do not get back to you on your complaints I got an available slot but when I ordered, it kept saying, ""no available slots"" Extremely disappointed with the app and service",1,3
"15/07/20, its 5 day in a row now big basket has delivered me expired product. It seems like they dont care at all. Expired product was delivered and app is not able to exchange my product. Stop fake advertisement of delivering quality product and get this expired product exchanged on priority. I have again received same expiring product. Its 3 times now since last 3 days. After advising to do a quality check before shipping, still expiring product was delivered.",1,0
"Bigbasket is a very good online grocery shopping app. But, during this difficult period of the coronavirus pandemic. The application is a total failure. 95% of the times slots are not available. And when there are slots available the app crashes. Pls get this application fixed as soon as possible.",1,23
"The app shows slots available. Even it shows date and time slots. However after selecting items and going to check out option app shows No Slots are available please try latter. This is very annoying experience as selecting items for the month, adding takes time and at the end the app makes you helpless. Support team says keep trying, (Don't start crying). But for how many times and for how many days? Why should I depend upon Big Basket, who are making us helpless? Are we at their mercy?",1,114
Have a very bad experience with this app every time I ordered. Few items will be removed from my basket showing unable. But the same product will be available book the next order it has happened 3-4 times with me and I m fed up of this app now and not going to use it again,1,2
"I think, your slots will be available after end of this lockdown. Right? Local grocery shops are far better than you. Atleast they try to serve. You are just showing off after starting of lock down. Bloody slots will available only for BB star member! Normal customers are GOD. They don't need foods. Very disappointing. Try to not to take your services. BIG ZERO star should give to you. Absolutely Rubbish.",1,12
I have uninstalled the app because the for the past 1 week or so there are no slot available. Whenever it will show the slot availability timing then also the slot is not available. Have just reinstalled the app by reading ceo's statement. I just hope this time it time it will work. Big basket should have a good time to pick up the market at this crisis which flipkart has done successfully but it is a complete failure frombthe big basket team.,1,27
"This app use to work, but during COVID19 it's a complete failure. Although it shows slot available in the main page, but during check out no slots are available. Add items in cart is a wastage of time and effort. If you cannot support during need, then you are of no value to customer.",1,8
"If I am given 500 chances to rate this app, I'll put same one star rating for all the times. Because this is the number of times I have opened this app in last one month and never once it has shown me an open slot. The slots were always full despite taking their premium membership. To tease you they show the number of orders delivered every day. How on earth other people were able to place the orders that have gone to pendency when I have been equally trying day and night.",1,66
Everytime I order few things and out of that one or two items are always missing...why don't u people inform that to us before checkout or before billing I am uninstalling this stupid and fake app and not going to order anything anymore.,1,0
"Extremely useless app. I've been a regular customer of BB since 2017 and have never been disappointed. But in such a time of need when I've no other option but to rely on you, you've failed me. It's been over 15 days since I've tried to get a single slot but never been able to. I've seen several BB Trucks delivering to my location but I still don't manage to find a slot. Whenever there's a slot shown available , it's gone before even checking out. Waste of time and money don't use this app",1,42
"For the past two months never ever do they have any delivery slot available. Whenever you open the app, 'All Slots Are Full'. I mean getting tatkal tickets is even easier than this. Where Grofers and even Zomato and Swiggy are delivering groceries, they haven't been able to adapt. Even after 2 full months. I'm very disappointed.",1,1
"Why display the available slots at homepage when all you have to say during checkout is ""we dont have available slots currently"" I have been trying many times from past 8 days and its the same. Why waste user's time ? learn from other apps they've made all items ""temporarily not available"". Atleast we would know that you are not in a situation to service at these challenging times.",1,19
"It shows me that the slot is available, then when I go to checkout, it shows slot is no more available. And there are so many slot options, but none available. What is it? You guys only delivering to BB star customers? I feel that is the case. Hence, regular customer is no more important to you. So it feels like switching onto some other competitor.",1,3
"For the last few days whenever I am trying to order anything from the app, I am getting the slots aren't available. Atleast show us which slots are open and when is the time I can get the delivery. I am feeling totally helpless. During the time of needs the app or your service doesn't work, what's the use. Really feel bad to have trusted the app. I feel we users are getting fooled.",1,13
Just install this app. When ever i tried to check out it say all slots are full. This is going on for a month. They won't send a reminder too saying that slots are available now. M a customer and m not happy with your poor service. What measure will you take up to overcome this issue? If you can serve during this hard time then when you will make yourself usefull. Yea and i check every now and then. I see no hope so m writting this review.,1,70
"Rubbish app. Always shows slots full. Even if slots available still cannot place on. In trying times you dont help who will buy from you later. I have been doing exactly what you say for last many days checking every hour. Please except that you all are useless. 23/04/20- You can buy the same from Amazon 3 to 4 days assured delivery. I did same. Have deleted the App for good. Your other reviews speeks volumes. Guys Amazon daily and Amazon Pantry are just awesome, same stuff and you will get",1,17
"I have trying from last 10 days. The app shows that either slot is unavailable or full. BB team, I have been buying groceries from last 3 years. During this period of lockdown, I don't see your support. Many times, I called customer care but they keep on assuring that operations will start in next 2 days. Please support us by supplying groceries or your will loose the trust of many customers like me.",1,110
I am getting very poor experience from last 15 to 20 days.I can understand due to lockdown the slots are not available but how it can be possible that the slots are unavailable from so many days. Request you to kindly check on this. And if slots are not available then why it is been allowed to add products in the cart. Really un acceptable service.,1,7
Worst app for shopping essentials... I am trying to buy from last 2 weeks.. everytime I enter the only msg that flashes is slot not available... tired in morning and night as well still the same.. it also asks you to become a premium member to get high priority... even if you try to take the membership... the app says something broke from our side...no notifications of the next slot dates.. the worst part is also adding address.. if you put your home address manually still the app will not show,1,1
"No slots available for delivery. Have added items in the cart but couldn't place order since delivery slots full all day. Also, from last 2-3 days app was crashed couldn't open anytime. I had to uninstall and reinstall, after logging in the cart is empty. I am not sure what slots you take order and what slots you people deliver. Provide some clarity on the app on this. This will help us to decide if we can rely on BB to deliver groceries in this current situation.",1,48
"Absolutely abysmal. They accept orders and then keep on cancelling hours after due time. This has happened so many times that it seems like policy. Support is perhaps dead - they haven't responded once. My wallet money is completely unusable and I waste valuable time trying to redeem it, with the same result. The app experience is weird. They show items as available and allow building a cart, only to remove most of it at the end. A hellish experience, particularly during lockdown.",1,84
"Worthless app. I added all items that i wanted to. But while checking out, it asked for login. Post login it emptied my basket. I added all those again and tried to order, it said no slots available even if homepage mentioned next available slot as tomorrow 2:30-430. it was frustraiting and total waste of time as well as efforts. 👎👎",1,3
"Slots available on home page for my address. But during checkout it comes as Sorry no slots available to serve you. Technical error in the app. It should be consistent st both places. Don't just reply with the default template message. We are saying we are not able to make order, then how do you expect to reply with order details. Still you have not addressed the issues. Slot showing in home page but unable to checkout",1,3
"Pathetic customer service and always behind useless ways to make money and confusing customers insted of ensuring required service. No penalty for self for not meeting commitments but charge cancellations to customers. On complaining on chat the feature itself vanishes from easy access, God knows where the chat service is hidden while I report this, at least not in help section. Unprofessional approach.",1,4
"I was told that if you will not be satisfied then you can cancel the BB membership within 15 days of subscription , from last 10 days there is no slot available so I want to cancel the membership but there is no options for cancellation. I have written many times to the email provided by you but still there is no response from developer team. And if you would like to then I can share snapshots too. Mostly daily I am writing to developer teams.",1,32
"I had ordered a lots of time with in two months since I had installed the app but now these days I have made my cart with bulk items and I am waiting from the last 3 days to get these items from you and every day and night I see that the slots are available and when I go for checkout it shows ,, sorry slots are not available and then trying again and again the items that I select get out of stocked ,. @bigbasket u r totally disappointing this time!! Only priority is available for bbstar members.",1,5
"Being a star member , I'm not getting a slot since 10 days , I'm trying again and again but not getting the slot , is this the way you treat star members also , I'm fed with your app , it's just that I'm having balance in my wallet so I'm trying to use it otherwise there's too much negligence on your side . I had a bad experience on your BB daily too , very irregular , had to call them every alternate day . Big Basket if you cannot handle then please don't let people add their things to basket .",1,13
"Some of the item showing available, but checkout time, item would be removed saying as not available. On my main page next available slot is showing with date and time, but when I check out is showing as 'do not have any available slot to service you right now.' Use this app for first time, but I feel it is not useful.",1,28
"It was my all time favourite grocery app till now. But at this time when I am in need you people are saying slots are not available. I am not getting any slots for last 15 days. Whatever I'm getting, getting from nearby shops and managing any how. So these so called giants are useless for society at this crucial time. I have decided to get the groceries from nearby shops only for the life time. . .",1,0
"I have been using BB for a very long time, however in times like these it is surprising that we keep receiving the msg that 'All slots are full'. When other providers like DMart, Big Bazaar, Amazon can deliver despite of the situation, how come BB is unable to support their customers. It is sad to see the largest online grocery provider does not have a solution even after a month of lockdown. Thoroughly disappointed.",1,37
Worst experience in first use only..it is working fine if you take membership subscription other wise they won't bother about you. I tried to buy and whenever go for check out option whole application will stop working. It's look like they blocked Normal people who doesn't have subscription. And after wards again of I try it will say products are not available. Guys it's really disgusting app. Dnt install this and dnt pay blindly any amount because customer care never pick your call for issues,1,4
"Can't Rate less than 1, that's why 1. Useless App. You will recieve a msg, delivery slot available, you can Order. When you try to check out and select a slot, No slots are available. If no slots are available, why are showing available. This happens every time. Moreover you orfer for 109 Rs or 1500 Rs, you will be charged delivery charges. Strange.... Items showing available, you order, pay in advance, before delivery, item is not available. Again if you check, item is showing as available.....",1,40
"Every time delivery slot full then buy bbstar and Last 3day every 1hour later i check ,always all slot full.",1,0
App is still crashing now and then. Twice in a month I ordered certain item which was not delivered though the item does show up as available on the app. I don't know what's going on but it is getting really frustrating. If you can not deliver a certain item to my location then better not show it in the first place. Very disappointed...,1,9
I have been trying for 3 months . There is never a slot . I have taken the bb star membership. Kept my order ready and waiting for a slot . Even it says slots so and so ready . Then they slot not ready in 1 second . I have emailed them . This is the first time I tried bb . But 3 months waiting . I have my money stuck there . Uf,1,32
I installed the app only a week back and absolutely loved it. But since my first order I am unable to place the next one. I am trying since 5 days and all I see is try again later no slots available. But on home page it does show the slot as available. This sucks. At least give the option to select slots which are after 2-3days so that we can pre order. What is the point of showing the slot as today express delivery and unable to even place the order ? Very bad.,1,24
"After the recent update, the app is crashing. It just won't open, have tried many times. Guys please get this corrected. Also, last couple of times, after I placed the order, the items were cancelled just before delivery. If the item is not in stock, kindly update it on the app as well and if it is, then you should ensure it is delivered. Very disappointed, even though I understand these are tough times. All I'm saying is - update stock availability on the app too.",1,20
"At first, when I select my location, it shows available slot on homepage. But when I go to checkout, it shows no slot available for your location. Its frustrating. Mostly all apps does the same thing. I can understand, if you don't have slots available in this situation. But atleast don't show false data.",1,127
Even though My Address is in Non Containment Zone. BB shows slots available but on final checkout option. It shows No Slots Available. Had raised this issue with customer care a month back but yet unresolved. While on other hand Grofers has been billing and delivering orders upto 1 lac per day in my vicinity . BB you should be framed in on the wall. The basket variety is good but of no use for people.,1,3
Really fed up with this app. I am trying to order my groceries since three days. Loging in every ten minutes but it always show slot not available. When does the slot will be available. If slots are not available indefinitely it should just stop me from adding groceries into basket. Then why would I login every ten minutes in the hope of getting slots.,1,11
Slots available but fake availability It shows slot available but while going to payment page it shows no slots available. Complained customer care no reply from them. I am waiting and checking app for every 30 minutes for slot availability. When I found it is available I got happy but after that I found it is fake. Very bad experience,1,2
The app doesn't even give proper notifications. You wont get notifications when delivery slot is available.......I literally have to stay and keep checking the app for 2 hours and then MAYBE I get a slot. Very poor slot availability even for star members (such as me). Request the developers to add notifications for delivery slot availability.,1,7
Request to all Don't download this app Poor communication and pathetic service. Its more then 1 month slots not available... continues trying but always full. It's show that bigbasket not capable to provide service during this time and fail to fullfill demands of customer. We can understand if slots going full for 10 to 15 days due to load but your app showing slots not available since last 1 month...it means you stopped your services due to lack of strength to reach all customers.,1,0
"I am using BB for longtime but from last 3 months it's always show no slots available. but Flipkart and grofers delivering grocery to my house 😁 on-time and on slot.. so I am uninstalling big basket app, why waste my phone space for a non working app... Bye-bye big basket...",1,1
"Horrible app. I downloaded it recently and placed my first order. Most of the things were unavailable. I managed to find some of the items I wanted. On the day of delivery, I got a mail saying that my order has been modified as some items aren't available. They don't refund the amount, instead you can use the money to shop from big basket again. I ordered for the second time using wallet money, and again on the day of delivery my order got modified. Now I have to order again, hopefully last time",1,3
"Very bad experience with this app..every time most of items are out of stock ..even if you pay for the item ,you can not be sure that you will get item ...very rare and very nominal discounts ..Most of the items are on it full value..Very sad for it's experience",1,2
"No use when you most need them. It's been over a week and after putting so much effort in carefully putting items in the basket, they say there are no available slots. On your home screen however it does say when the next slot is available. If you cant deliver say it upfront. Don't waste time like this.",1,22
"On my main page 'next available slot' is showing standard date and time, but when I check out it is showing as 'we do not have any available slots to service you right now'. What stupidity is this. Some of the items is showing available, but when we go to check our cart the item would be removed saying as not available. I feel that app has lost its standards. Cause in the current scenario of COVID19 the app should help people.",1,68
"previously, it was a good app with great inventory. Nowadays, it is the worst grocery app. No stocks, no inventory. Whatever you search, is not available. Even local grocery has more stock. Other apps are doing better and in the same lockdown. Being a bbstar member, I regret spending money on bbstar membership",1,3
"I wanted to give zero star but that can't be. It shows standard slots for delivery available but when I try to place my order it shows ""ALL SLOTS FULL"". and bla and bla. I tried to use it 1st time but experience was terrible. I terribly recommend that ""THIS APP IS NOT WORTH INSTALLING THEN ALSO IF YOU WANT TO WASTE YOUR DATA YOU MAY INSTALL IT.",1,3
"Rating 0/5 App Not recommended Useless app. No slots available. And when available then stocks are unavailable. Customer care does not respond. Totally disgusted with the app as well as their services. I have requested 9 times for the transfer of funds into my original mode of payment, as I wanted to buy the products from another source dur to lack of money in the bank due to the current situation but no response yet. This is the kind of services provided to the customers.",1,52
Giving one star is more than enough to this app. It just making money from the current panic situation. They mentioned bb membership will have priority and advantage. After paying money for membership they didnt even ship atleast one item from last 4 days. Every time they are cancelling order in last minute and adding the prepaid amount/money to their stupid wallet. You cant get back money( it will stick in their wallet) and thet not even ship a single item. Its better not to trust them.,1,12
"You had cancelled a prepaid order for 15th april and said that amount will be refunded in bbwallet. But till today am unable to see any amount. Ridiculous service, the app shows the slots are available but once i reach checkout the product shown as Out of stock abd then slots are also shown as full. By luck if we are able to place an order in these difficult time. You people cancel that order and then never return the money. Had mailed you on both emails : customer + appsupport ....",1,1
"App shows there's no slot available.. And when it shows tomorrow's slot of 3 to 7 is available, and after adding things to cart when we go to cart it shows all items are out of stock, then after few minutes it shows again no slots available and all the things are available, you even get notified for it that things are available.. It's frustrating and annoying",1,1
"It has become the worst app , they keep giving u slots n keep changing every time , n all the time the slot will be full... I have my order ready in the cart since 16/4/2020 . But I am not able to book because slots are full, there intention is to sever who has taken there membership only others keep waiting, i might get old n die but there slots is always full",1,3
Literally i have been monitoring this app day and night since last more than a week hoping to get a slot. But never do they have a slot available. Better you just say that you won't deliver so that we can look for alternatives instead of wasting customers time. Because you tempt them showing that all the products are available however what's the point if you never ever deliver them. Once it showed that a slot is available from 6.30-9 & i specifically woke up at 6.30 to order but then again full.,1,3
"Waste of time, as a developer I could suggest something that if you people are not able provide the service at some point of time like the community is suffering from corona, you have to disable the application for some period, or you can customize the landing page of the site with some guidelines and instructions that could be helpful for the end user. As I logged in to the app and added number of products and quantities in the basket in order to place the order. I spent approx 1 hour in. 🙏",1,7
The worst service provider. I wish I could give even less than this. But unfortunately there is no negative marking available . No slots are available from April. I suggest everyone should Uninstall this app.,1,0
I'm using this portal since three year...but after lockdown your app is not working for me atleast. In my siciety your delivery is coming everyday. But from last three month when i'm going to checkout my basket...app giving msg that sorry we do not have any available slot...why when the delivery is coming in my siciety ...its difficult to understand....i raise the concern many time but no response...so i quit from bb and dowl Grofer...there services are very good.,1,12
"Don't go for bbstar membership, because there is nothing like priority slots for anyone. I am trying from last 5 days accurately as per the slots timing i.e almost 6-7 times a day but even after that app was showing me message as ""Unfortunately, we did not have any available slots to service you right now. Please try again later"".",1,8
"I was asked to update the app. There was a slot free when I updated. As soon as i added products to my cart, the slot was gone. What's the point of having big basket when you have this terrible service.. That too in this difficult time!! The App was showing open slots, but then also the order was not taken.. That only means your server is too slow.. Then why the hell was it showing that slot was open?? I have already mailed to customer care with screenshots.",1,73
"I wish, I could add Screenshot. You kept on showing slot availability for almost 5-10 minutes but everytime I tried placing order it said Slots are Full. If you don't have slot why making False update on app regarding slot availability, even if this is technical glitch it's bad since you playing with Customers emotions who are dying for Few Groceries and gets happy looking at slot availability. I understand it's tough time and agree that not all wishes could be fulfilled (reached word limit)",1,3
unpacked items such as fruits and vegetables doesn't seem to have ordered weight. you pay high for less quantity.,1,0
"I have been bbstar for very long time, in this pandemic situation we were relying on you. All the time app shows slots available , but when I go at checkout page it says no slots available. I don't understand on what criteria they decide the slots availability. Please make it clear on that. I have been trying to book a slot for more than two weeks but till now I didn't get it.",1,124
Pathetic during lockdown. No slots available. Everytime you try to check out it says items out of stock. Instead of helping during lockdown it's been totally useless since March 2020 till date. Amazon Pantry has been better.,1,1
I can see there are 3 slots available however whenever I am selecting any of these getting error slots not available facing this issue for more than 2 hours now. Getting frustrated can you guys help what's the matter. I have also tried the same on the web version as well getting the same thing slots are full.,1,2
"Please hire best UI/UX designer, Android developer team. So many issues in your app, 1. check out process is completely pathetic not at well designed, 2. Fix the Google map marker issue, 3. Without login fill out cart and then logged into app, then cart becomes empty. Why? And many more. Suggestion Work on your end user flow, make it short and well designed.",1,12
Slots showing available but I hve been trying to place order for past 20 days but unable to order. There are technical glitches. Cart getting emptied all of a sudden. Unable to get n to the next level. First get things sorted out for your application. Take some time and convey updates to the customers rather than to create a havoc and panic. The customers care services are worst....,1,14
This Hard time i am very disappointed with this application. I try to buy some item but it's always show 'sorry slots are full etc' if you are not have capicity to service to your customers ask google pay Store to lock this application for downloading for now...and change your your application dp to 'We don't have capicity to provide services now' don't missguided needy people guys ...plz plz,1,4
"I was happy with this app but now a days I am really getting dissapointed with your services. I can understand lockdown, I can understand AMPHAN but it is now almost more than two months. Though the online services are now available but every time I Am getting the popup that slot is full!! I am getting frustrated now.Seriously. If you have started online services then there should be a slot at least.Either do something urgently or stop totally until you can arrange people. Be specific.Stay Safe!",1,140
DISAPPOINTING!!! It used to be one of the best app for grocery but nowadays (in such a critical situation) It has no slots available (since last 15 days) don't know to whom it is delivering but yes it has become an useless app on my phone.. i would not suggest it to anyone anymore! Grofers is much better than this..,1,1
It is more than a month that no slot are available and its happening for 5 months now..I live in an area where everyday big basket operates. In fact the warehouse is 400 mts from my place . Worst place to expect anything.,1,0
Guys be careful. World's leading antivirus Norton said India's largest grocery app contains privacy issue. The app shares data to another location. Recently Chinese company invested a huge amount to this app. So be careful. I already mail them with screenshot regarding this issue but they didn't reply. So most probably they aware of this. Don't use this app,1,0
"I have been trying to place an order since 3 days, the details mentioned on the home page says ""slot available in the next 2 hrs"", but after you take the trouble of adding things to your cart it says ""unfortunately, we do not have any available slots to service you right now, please try later."" And to mention I saw 3 bigbasket delivery agents in my area. Does a customer's time feel like a joke to you?",1,19
"I'm constantly trying to order from this nd the msg arise that this slot is unavailable, try for another & when we try for another slot, then also the same msg arise. If u can't provide ur services during this time, there is no use of such app during normal condition. And when I ordered my last order yesterday, the money was cut from my wallet but due to wrong address I had to cancel that and wanted to re-order, but neither there was any msg or email of cancellation nor they returned my money😡.",1,23
"I downloaded the app in March 2020 opted for BBstar member and till date the only notification this app is showing is 'All slots are full. Try again later'. Had complained to customer support via chat but the executive was not helpful, kept saying that they are sorry that I couldn't get any slot but no actual work/help was given. When asked to connect me to their supervisor/senior members might be able to help...guess what the executive stopped replying and completely ignored my chat message.",1,47
"Till Corona lockout, BB worked well. Now when opening app, slot availability is shown very rarely. If checked out immediately with items in cart , app shows no time slot available. Why different slot status at 2 places of app. Complained customer care. No actions taken so far. Pls show slot availability correctly for particular locations. Even after 2 months of starting lockout, 50 percent or more items out of stock Big basket also badly affected",1,5
"Could be better. Disappointing thing I faced is the next available slot is being shown in the app, immediately when I tried to checkout it is again showing unfortunately no slots are available.",1,1
"Big basket is a complete failure in the time of need during Covid19 lockdown. The app is functional just as a show off, it is not allowing to order and everytime shows slots not available to everyone. If no one is able to book, how the slots are unavailable everytime. Just a pathetic application and ridiculous support system.",1,6
"Worst ever app . Very slow . After i add the items in the cart & at the time of payment it says items are not available & no slots to deliver. Really disgusting. Website is slower than ant""s walk . Really worst & useless app. No proper information about the availability of the items. This is misleading the customers . Just a scrap .app is not fast enough to build the cart. Really got vexed with bigbasket. This deserves a -0 rating but no chance of giving it. Bekar app",1,20
The app is extremely slow and shows items while shopping but when trying to check out it mentions many of the items are not available. Even after this when I was trying to checkout it doesn't take me to next landing page. And the app is extremely slow and UX horrible to use. It's a very bar experience in all.i had to add all my items 4 times and yet it it didn't finally take me to payment portal.,1,242
"At this highest time of need, you are not able to provide slots, technical errors and many more is going. Then what is the use of it. In general days we can go out and purchase vegetables. Worst app and worst service... never use and never recommend. If u can't manage, do not start a business.",1,399
"Very bad experience in this time of crisis the app which should be helpful are the one which are giving us headache! I'm done with this app, no use of it at all, they have there direct supply chain with the shop keepers or the vegetables sellers who buy easily in a bundle but for always the slot is full done with this nonsense politics. I don't understand why everything is political influence.",1,7
I never able to checkout even single items in this app. Always it shows slot is full. Not a single day. Almost i see this for last two months. Now I am starting to look other better aps. I don't want to waste my time on this. One of the worst app I have ever seen.sorry guys Definitely Big basket will fall down soon if they continue their services like that.,1,19
"It is said ""when the going gets tough, the tough get going."" My personal experience BigBasket has been absolutely disappointing during the lockdown. Even after the lockdown conditions were relaxed, every time i have got the message 'all slots full', yet they would 'proudly' announce 2 lakh deliveries completed. God knows to whom. Proved to be totally unreliable.",1,5
Not able add items in cart,1,1
"This is the second time I am writing about this issue, the first time I let it slide because I understood the situation was bad, but I have continuously tried for 30 days to get groceries and some other items on your app( I live near Khalisha Kota, Kolkata ), and it seems you never have slots available either in home page or during checkout. I am appalled and infuriated that your competitors and even food delivery apps can deliver groceries here but you cant. Fix this ASAP",1,2
"I have very bad experiences with BB. They are not accepting sodexo cards and missing items in the ordered list. Couple of times i faced the same issue and end up wasting my time calling BB customer care to listen to their regular term "" Technical Issue"". Recently got to know that if an item is missed in the ordered list then Sodexo card won't work. Crazy!!! They miss the item in the list and claim it as returned by customer instead of compensating for the missed item. Bb chat support is horrible",1,13
"Too bad...for the last 5-6 days contiuously trying this app for home delivery, but no response, and telling no slots available..moreover continuously sending messages that this particular items are available, that items available,if during the time of shopping if they have shown the particular items are unavailable ..so if the items are available then why are they not delivering..in this crisis time when we need the service urgently.. Send so many mails in customer care also , vut no response.",1,15
"Keep on getting issues with slots during check out though home page still shows slots available. If slots are really not available , going back on home page must show same message of slots not available. Instead of that it is still showing slots available. So it seems there is a big issue with slot allotment in application or development teams is not really interested in making user experience better eventhough I see so many similar issues posted for this app.",1,43
"You are really good but for last 4 to 5 days I am not able to book any order. Everytime it is showing that all slots are booked , pls try again. At least give an option to notify us on slots availability so that we can order accordingly. I understand the situation but we have to move forward I believe. Would be great if you develop a feature to notify users for available slots.",1,49
"Technical Glitches - Update on you app needed. After 45 mintues of selecting products finally this app asked me for email id, which is ok but then after I entired my email id, all my previously selected products were deleted, unlimitely prompting me to choose the products all over again. So my question is, if it's important for the email id then why does this app allows the customers to shortlist the products, which totally a waste of time for the consumers.",1,5
"1)The integration of the app with the inventory is faulty. It accepts the order and just before delivery, it sends a notification that few items are unavailable and the refund is credited to wallet. As per the norms the amount should be credited back to the original mode of payment. 2) Besides, today the products were literally dumped at my door ( even though I had hung a packet for contactless transfer) as a result, one of product ( 1kg sauce bottle) broke. Customer service portal useless.",1,70
I have never been able to checkout with my purchase. This message is always on display' All slots are full please try after some time'. Is this some kind of joke or are we made fools of.,1,1
"I must say I am very disappointed with this app because it's been over month that I have not got any delivery slot and it still continues to say the same. Also there is a lot of bug in the app because on the home page it shows that a delivery slot is available but the moment I try to check out, it says no delivery slots available. I mean what the hack is this. After spending so much time in adding items to the cart it shows this. Also I have 630 rs in my wallet which I am not able use.",1,28
"Hilarious experience. Since last day I am not getting any delivery slot (being a BBStar Member). The delivery slot was available only for 10mins today, even then I have not get success. But at the same time the items I need most are getting unavailable one by one. It's really frustrating and disappointing. Your service is good for nothing.Even the customer support portal is totally inactive.",1,25
"Worst... for last 15 days trying to place the order but continuously saying slots are full. If slots are full then why taking the bookings ? Aged person keeping an expectation that my turn will come. But really frustrating!!! Today showing that slots available. But when going for checkout, showing slots are full !!! No contact us, nothing.... typical marketing question, no place to contact or complain booking...",1,0
First it was a good app now it has become a stupid app which want let you pay by Cash a card. They just want to force you to pay from other payment sites. Good bye big basket no more shopping from your website,1,0
"Even after the update of this app, I am still facing same problems every day, not able to checkout with the items I put in the Basket. Big Basket should mention in the app that which areas in pune, there will be no delivery of items so that people know, this will be more helpful. Please let me know if you can deliver near sadhu Vaswani chowk, pune.",1,13
"Worst support ever. When i see homepage it shows slots availability, but when i try to checkout the items it gives me error unfortunately there is no slot available. Then i go to homepage again to check the slot availability, it was still displaying the slots available but when i try to checkout again i got the same error. No response from customer service of big basket. Seriously tired of it now",1,10
"Home page slots are available.. but at checkout slot not available. Again go back to home page and slot is available.. at Checkout slot is not available. I am not rating the slot availability but the software glitch. If slot is available at home page, then it should be applicable for checkout too.. Do not reply again that it is due to too many orders.. The concern is about the app and not about slot availability",1,0
"I want to exchange the items and exchange slots are showing but it's not working and keep showing ""Error from the side , Our engineers are working "" . FIX THIS BIG BASKET",1,1
"When I return back from office, all shops are closed nowadays. For that purpose I installed this worst app. I paid 500 in wallet including the premium fee. More than 10 days, slot is till not available. Going to uninstall. If u want money, Please beg. Don't cheat people like us who are working for nation in lock down",1,2
"Highly disappointed with this app. I am trying to place an order since last 10 days, and it just keeps showing that there are no slots available. And even when it shows that a slot is available, it won't accept the order. When you add items in the basket, it let's you add it.. But as soon as you go to checkout it shows that the item is out of stock",1,6
"Very Disappointed , always show all slots full . Wastage of time , if you guys aren't able to give services during this lockdown then what we can expect . When everything will be normal then there is so many other app are there to serve us . Big basket is brand and we had expections but Seriously i am going to uninstall this and never ever i am gonna install this again.",1,2
"Worst app I took me lot of time to detect my location. I have to click multiple time to select the goodies. Then when i check out everything went away . I again selected and did checkout . I have to add address three time , then it took my address . After that when i click on next i got message we do not have any available slot . Why dont u show before checkout . Worst app full of bugs .",1,23
Very dissappointed with big basket as I am a bbstar member I thought that all the things will be easily available now but now also as we add any thing in the cart it shows products not available. Many groceries and vegetables can only be added once a time & if they are unavailable then it takes weeks for them to be back again in the app. Don't know what BB is doing. 😞😞,1,4
"Very bad service. Slots are showing available, time slot is changing from one to another, but at the time of check out, message appears with 'no availability of slots'. It is better to stop your service. We will overcome this Covid19 situation in future and will like to boycott this type of services. And please don't reply with 'apology' messages, rather do the needful.",1,2
"Useless app, will show slot available, when we try to order, it will say slot unavailable. If you dont know how to do business, please dont do. Its irritating, worst app ever, fooling people and wasting people time. Mistake downloading this app. Uninstalling right away this useless app.",1,0
Have been trying to book orders since 3 months. People in my building are able to find slots but not me. Do you only serve your star customers. If you dont give others a chance to place orders how will they become your premium clients. Very bad experience.,1,0
"Shows error: ""Unfortunately, we do not have any available slots to service you right now. Please try again later"" 24/7, even though it shows the timings in your next available slot. I don't know whom they are even serving. Items are there now and it's gone in a second, and then it's back again.",1,41
"It's been always all slots are full, why you can't just provide, dates option at least surety about the slots as timeline, and delaying notification as airplanes tickets, or movie show tickets etc. so that I can confirm about should I wait to order on this site or not. I understand the situation in COVID-19, but waiting for to order is worst part of it all, as you don't know when you get chance to confirm it. It's fine to provide future timeline or something feature like it.",1,90
"Shows available slots, the moment you checkout, it shows 'no slots available' which is absolutely unbelievable. If it's not deliverable, just say so initially, reflecting available slots in beginning than refusing whilst checkout is a joke, I understand you guys are fulfilling a high demand, but this way of handling is a joke. If you don't have slots, say so initially, we'd understand, rather than saying available first then no slots while checking out. RIDICULOUS!",1,4
"I'm bb star member and I can understand this covid-19 situation. Everyone need to get their slot. But, For me the slot is changing like anything. I selected my items in cart 6th April. But it said 'All slots are full'. The next day it shows 12th April 6AM to 11.30AM. On 12th it changed to 16th and changed to 18th April. Today when I opened the app it is refreshed and changed to Slots full. I am very very disappointed about this. If there is no slot available why you allowed to add cart.",1,26
Liked using the app earlier...but nowadays it is always 'no slots available' and even when there is a slot available..by the time you reach checkout..70% of the itmes are out of stock!!. Everyday they show a high number of customers catered to...but i have not seen a single delivery slot since many days,1,0
"Cost of several items are much higher then market such as Spencer's, easy day, big bazar etc. Secondy after adding item and checking out it shows few items are not available so that should have not be shown while adding up. Many other problem are therr with the application, not at all satisfied.",1,1
Tried multiple times to buy through BB on multiple occasions at different time slots.. And every time slots are not available.. At the time when you are supposed to be little extra helpful.... You are coming with zero solution.. extremely disappointing Deleting the app.. as its of no use.. Thanks for your kind service,1,6
"One of the most useless app I have ever come across. I have been trying to get a slot from past 10 days, and I have not got one during the lockdown. Where other apps are handling customer traffic easily, big basket is struggling to its core. Very bad experience.",1,1
Once I go to order it says one or two items are not available and it doesn't give option to remove in the same page.. Instead you need to go back identify which product it is as it doesn't tell which product that is not available. When I come back to order screen I get a message that delivery slot is not available where in you can see in the main window that the slot is available. Poorly built app.,1,3
After updation of the application... Keep on closing stating that big basket keeps stopping .... After reporting so many times no use . Unnecessarily I have loaded my money in the big basket wallet... Worse kind of service... Atleast not able to update the app without errors. Or resume it to the previous version where it is working properly. Please respond.,1,6
Would have given 0 star. Annoying app. Not user friendly. Also can anyone explain how to get slots ?? Why they don't show availability before adding items in Cart. It just kills our time.,1,1
"I am using this app for two years ...and a regular customer.. didn't find anything wrong, but in this hard time of lockdown I can't find a single slot of delivery Since March ending...I have tried a lot... I don't know why??? Who booked in this slots ?? It's useless app .. I am going to uninstall it.",1,2
"Previously this app doing very well, but form last 2 month's am unable to book any order, even another same apps are doing well, so what is your problem? We understand the problem during this period, but other apps are doing there's job so wht bigbasket not doing well? Please take care about this...",1,0
"Very disappointed, it's a complete waste to keep this app as services are exhausted, I am trying since last 15 days for delivery slots, slots are showing but never goes to payment mode and finally I have to uninstall and it's service forced me to give this poor rating. Avoid this app. A complete waste of Time.",1,2
"The worst app and business run by frauds of highest degree. I was lured for BB Star membership but ever since I opted for this paid membership, I was never ever able to find a slot. The BB team kept giving false assurances. Ultimately I asked them to refund my wallet balance and BB Star membership charge but still I have not received any response from these shameless people. My Advice : DON'T INSTALL THIS APP, DON'T DEAL WITH THE FRAUDSTERS OF BIG BASKET.",1,14
"It keeps showing since last one and half months continuously that all slots are busy in Ahmedabad. It runs a useless membership whose members do not get any slot. How come all slots always remain booked for so long when they do not allow any booking? During 1 week's ban in Ahmedabad for home delvery, it kept showing all slots busy & when ban was lifted, it kept showing that ""they are working out with authorities to allow home delivery""! And their response is still silent about this.",1,3
"Absolutely Rubbish App. Keeps Crashing. Shows a lot of items for sale but on checkout 80% of the items are always "" Out of Stock"" . Total Time waste. On delivery of Vegetables & Fruit you get Rotten Vegetables, Sour Unripe fruits, One kg. of Fruit delivered will be actually only 800 gms. Trying to Ape the West but with the dirty Cheater Attitude of keralite Indian. Shame on U.",1,3
Using this app for more than 8 months but last 22 days not able to place any order even after resuming service due to lock down every time its show slot full and even its show slot available then during check out its show no slot available despite having bb membership no special services offered during these tough time for regular customer despite compliant raised.now its more than one month not able to place a single order. Still as on 25 no slot ??,1,3
"Came here to rate 1 star after a frustrating experience of waiting 1 long week of getting my order delivered. First, getting a slot is tougher than booking a tatkal ticket. (Sometimes falsely shows data of empty slots and when I happily choose items and go to checkout page, slots are full!!) Next if by chance I get a slot (AFTER 2 DAYS MINIMUM) then it gets ""cancelled due to operational constraints""!! 👎👎 So I again place order which again has no slot AND THE CYCLE CONTINUES..............",1,21
"Crappy checkout process One creates a list of items on the cart. Takes time to do it, i might have atleast spent around 15 mins to add about 5 items to the cart.. Click on checkout, it shows some items arent available, you have to go back make edits. Then click on checkout the app now shows that there arent any available slots... Why waste time from the beginning cant the app show tat they are no slots availble before loading my cart??. I have items on my cart for thr last 4 days..",1,109
Haven't been able to place a single order during the lockdown period. Don't see any use of extending the star membership now. Had it been a week or so it would've been fine. But the fact that there have been no available slots for the past 20 days is just unacceptable and poor management.,1,4
"Useless now. I've been waiting for weeks to get a slot for Ayanavaram. When I finally got a booking, the delivery personnel just claimed area was a containment zone and ran. I got delivery from Grofers and Amazon trucks on the same and subsequent days. For the record, We were never in any sort of containment zone.",1,0
"Not getting any slots from last month when I installed the app. Very bad Update: well after lockdown only after bb is not allotting any slots, I had tried another app for home delivery and found that it serving most products to me. Now I've been using that app from 3 months and bb is useless for me in this time.",1,2
"Totally useless app..charges delivery fees but delivers late..some items are out of stock and they will tell this you half an hour before delivery..refund should be given in mode of payment done but they will return it to thier own wallet which is useless..and most importantly their customer service will never reply...in short, this is the shittiest app I have ever used..they actually deserve 0 star. ..AVOID USING THIS APP AND RATHER GO FOR SOME OTHER APPS LIKE DUNZO OR GROFERS",1,1
"Shows slots available, but I'm unable to complete my order. As soon as i go to the checkout page, it says no slots available, even when on the home page I have a slot. ///Please resolve this issue. This has been going on since the lockdown. Other platforms have started delivering now///",1,10
They modify items in the end while packing and give reason not available at that time. But still shows it for buy in app. Modified item price goes to wallet not in original source so have to make a request for transfer. This is another strategy to take money from client because amount of orders they don't deliver at the end time is about 100 rs 200 approx in big order. You have to place another order of 600 rs for free or else pay 50 rs for delivery for the items not delivered in last order.,1,29
Shiitiest app ever. After adding all the products in the end it tells you if the product is out of stock. What the hell are you guys doing. In these times of need you guys are playing with people or what. If items are not available just show it before hand dont waste people time. Never going to use this app again. If you guys are you incase out to f order dont waste people time. Show it on home screen.,1,6
"Very disappointed with your service with bb star membership... in this situation of pandemic you were supposed give extensive service to the customer, but your slots are always full... every time i open the app, i find that all slots are full...then what is the benefit of having bb star membership...your are not capable to serve the customers in this pandemic situation...",1,8
Literally no slots available. I was try since a week but now also it is showing no slots available and try again later. I was expecting this type of experience and now I have shifted to grofers,1,0
"This App Sucks. I'm Trying For Last 10 Days But It Always Says No Slots Available. And It Also Says That 90% Of Your City Customer Have Slots Available, I Guess I'm The Only One Wo Comes Under 10%. I Even Purchased BB Star Membership But No Use. So, Finally I've Ordered Groceries From Grofers And Got Delivered Within 3 Days. Grofers, Amazon, Spencers Are Delivering Goods Within Time But Big Basket Have Tremendous Demand Pressure, Wow. I'm Never Gonna Buy Again, Even After Lockdown.",1,2
"I have been opening this site for the last 15 days, it says everytime your slot from 1030amto 130pm. .today i credited rs 1000/ in my acount of bb. Even then it shows same slot for tomorrow. Either you dont have capacity to serve or not. If not don't advertise for online service.",1,2
"One star because 0 is not at option, this app is garbage I don't understand is it because of this lockdown going on or is it a usual thing. It not even about that I got the app and everything was available at such a low price and I filled my cart with whatever and as I check out slots become full things prices get hiked, things become unavailable I was like what the heck and I tried that on my moms phone and it was the same situation, show whatever it Is on all circumstances.",1,2
Can't beleive it's the same BigBasket.Lot of attitude it gets from the time it was earlier.I was so loyal to this and had recommended to many. Took BBStar membership for many years but all futile. In these tough times when customers wants the product delivered they have only shown attitude and ignored customers request repeatedly.After a month back I tried again BB but only oversmart attitude has grown.Thanks with this I shifted myself full time to JioMart & Amazon. To hell with you !,1,0
"The app is glitched. On the home screen, it shows the slots are available. Next moment, while ordering, none of the slots are available. While we wait for slots to be available, items are no longer available. Complete waste of time using this app.",1,4
No slot since March 2020.... Worst services,1,0
Past few days its showing that to update the app. But am trying to update. Buts cant completing the last 1%. Its disgusting. So please check and rectify the issues as earliest,1,0
"I am not getting any slot at my location since the Day 1 of lockdown .I can see many can avail the service of bigbasket ,but my area which was not a containment zone couldn't avail it's service when we actually needed it . Highly disappointed",1,1
"Previously the app was working fine but now even after trying for 2 months, I can't get any delivery slot . At checkout, it only shows no slots able while my neighbor is able to order and gets it delivered and not only them my whole colony is getting it delivered . But at the same when I'm trying to order, it shows no slots available. Pls look into the problem.",1,30
Rates are too high of each item.,1,0
"Update: Back to 1 star...rotten fuits and.short delivery received. No response on chat or call. No return slot either. Makes me feel like a monkey on a vehicle windshield trying to access the banana inside the locked car. Why can't available dates be displayed no matter when, instead of making people constantly keep checking the app just in case they get lucky. I would rather go out to get groceries and risk getting infected than keep looking at the app for a slot.",1,58
"I like bigbasket and use simpl my only mode of payment. To my surprise, payment through simpl has failed! And it was removed from my third party wallet payment list. Dont you think there is a need to atleast notify your customers? I would love to see simpl as a mode of payment on big basket it just makes life easier!",1,5
"It's shows available slots but when we try to order it shows that Slot is not available and also it lies about membership, being a member they promised to reserve slots for delivery but they actually don't. The worst ever and frustating experienced so far. No clarity for location wise availability of products before checkout or they might manipulating it during order processing. Also they should make complaint option with tracking details in app only. I think it don't deserve even 1 Star",1,2
"Whenever you are about to checkout, things are out of stock... pathetic app. Only using it because of this virus. 20k products is just a gimmick. Please fix this app... always while checkout things are out of stock suddenly and then I get a message things are back in stock... so irritating to keep adding stuff into cart and then they are unavailable Edit.. That is not a very intuitive way of shopping online, once the product is added to the cart it shouldn't go out of stock..",1,6
Even if you're bbstar member you hardly get a slot available. App gets stuck when you navigate back to home screen and keyboard doesn't open. Orders are always partially delivered and inventory management should be improved. From my last 5 orders always something is missing and money is added to the wallet.,1,1
"Pathetic experience. There are no slots available EVER! have been trying since over a month now, but same popup - No Slots Available! Highly disappointed!!",1,1
Home page shows available delivery slots. But while checkout it shows no slots available and asks to try again later throughout the day. If you cannot deliver close out your catalog n don't allow to add anything to cart. The usefulness of your service is determined by the way you serve during difficult times like this and I feel your app is useless.,1,13
"Worst customer support ever ,after explaining the problem still no response..",1,0
Always display slot are full. When to open the slot and how much total order will allowed in each slot? So it is very irritating to check each 30 min slot are open or not if open order place or not place. So please display the time for opening the slot and remaining order allowed count for each slot. I already taken membership but my total membership fee is wested.,1,1
U have charged 300 for bb star membership. And everytime it shows slot is available i will rush for confirming the order. But then it shows no slot available. It has become a daily practice. Daily almost 30 to 40 times i will try to book whenever slot is available but still fails.,1,2
Last few weeks I was struggling to get delivery slot and was under impression that bb is heavily loaded but discovered u are trying to grow customer base actually. I installed the app on different phone and logged in with new account . Well got surprised to see order is placed successfully. Now when I check back by old account slot is still not available. Pure cheating guys... During covid situation u can think of such stupid things.,1,3
This app even though avaliable slots are showing while checking out the items its giving message saying that no slots available to service now.In this crunch situation if its happening like this..what is the use. Worst app i would call and not recommended. Hello your app only shows the slot but when we try to check out the items its says slots not available. If slots are not available why your app should show available slots??,1,7
"You get things delivered or not, you get a slot or not.. Bigbasket will freeze 300 rs for membership.. My money was booked for 3 months but never got a chance to order anything as slots were always full.. Poor service.... Grofers, bigbazar, spencer... All of them are dispatching their products... Even on time.. But this is one fake service which repeatedly failed to take any order.",1,1
"I didn't liked a few feature on this app: 1. In case your online/wallet payments get failed (which usually happen while there is an offer applicable) then your order will automatically become COD. 2. They cancel the order and then call back to confirm the address and then automatically mark the order as delivered, now you need to text the CC and waste your time with them. 3. CC is very irresponsible as they go and check with some team for everything and you need to wait for a day.",1,35
"Worst app ever, i placed an order using cash on delivery, at the time of delivery i got a call and got informed that i need to pay for my order online or my order will be canceled, worst service ever forcing customers to pay online after selecting cash on delivery, if you are unable to collect cash just disable the option of cash on delivery, such cheap tactics to make cash.",1,0
Irritated as Refund for paid item not done and no message or support from BB,1,0
"This company has good potential due to the market they are in but, its a shame how basic features are missing in such a widely used app, patched up loop holes and it failed miserably at the time of need. If you can invest in Shahrukh Khan please also invest in logistics and load testing. Wish you a better future as there would be more competition in the future and not such monopoly.",1,5
"Pathetic behaviour...Showing slots available on the home page and on checkout shows no slots. Tried to contact customer support on call but its not reachable, no reply on chat support, They are just making joke and playing around in such situation, if you doesn't have slots then put it on the home atleast people will look for other and not waste time in adding items to the cart...Its really frustrating",1,2
I have been trying to order since last week. Every time I add stuff to the cart. Then I am informed that half the stuff is not in stock. So I search for alternatives. Then finally I am told there are no slots available. This has been happening on repeat and is a very big waste of time. So yeah that 1 star is me venting out.,1,4
"Doesnt let you log in using my email id, keeps saying email id already exists",1,0
"App not operational during any crisis situation. All other similar apps have provided more or less decent service in our area during lockdown except Bigbasket which did not allow us to place order even for once in last 2 months! After Amphan cyclone, most of the other apps had halted operations just for a day or two but even after 7 days, Bigbasket is still non operational.",1,0
"I am unable to login to the app after several trials. It sends me the login otp then keeps on giving errors like something went wrong, app is down for maintenance, even when it is auto detecting otp it is saying please enter correct otp. Worst ever experience, low standard of software. Big disappointment.",1,11
Worst app i have ever seen they have not given me the offer thing. I request play store to delete this app.i have written in the review but you people have not given the response. I want my offer thing anyhow because i have spend money on it,1,0
"Slots are never available!!! Even if it shows it is, you can never complete your order! They say they hold your items in your cart for 15mins but they won't be available in the next 2mins!! Am trying to place order over the past 5 days! I do understand the current situation but should the customer be waiting for nearly a week to place their orders???",1,0
"Just horrible service. Customer service too is bad. Cant delever then just shut down. App not updated properly. Quality not so good for fresh produce. Just horrible in general, although was good a long while ago. Very sad n disappointed.",1,2
"Bad quality products.. veggies are rotten and looks like kept packed for long time... From the time I am using your app I have faced issues, sometime wrong number updated in my profile..sometime rotten or expired items... At least at this situation stop thinking about money and fooling people... I don't think u guys are maintaining proper hygiene.. doubt on u guys now... I do have pictures of your product if you want . I can share it here or on social media which ever you like.",1,2
"Pathetic, they are showing the slot but ehen selecting the available slot, proceeding to pay the message is chosen slot is no more available and its happening since three earlier i thought the it was due the condition right now but now its the 3 day but still same issue. I even dont want to give one star",1,4

"In the two months of lockdown never did it have slots to serve the place i stay which it used to serve, then why give me messages after msgs with offers and bother me. Swiggy , ZOMATO on the other hand are doing excellent work in serving essentials. Am uninstalling the app. And even after COVID never going to use this useless shoppiing company.",1,0
"Worst app ever, please do not download, every 5 sec its getting signed out/session expired. Really tired after signing in 1000 times... I wish if it would have a person, i would have slapped this app 10000 times. Go and learn app development then develop an app. It's really worst app. Very irritating No words can describe my frustrations",1,7
"From March to July, I didnt get a single slot..where the other companies helps me to buy some essential products in this lockdown period.. very very bad experience Bigbasket..I'm uninstalling your app because it occupied my phone memory..useless..",1,1
"I am new to this app. Thoroughly disappointed. The app keeps showing error messages no matter how many times I try to order, and my basket keeps refreshing to show ""no items"" and I have to reiterate the addition of each item I previously had in my list. Wasted an hour on this.",1,2
"Useless. Every time says "" All slots are full, try after sometime."" Trying to place order since last 45 days, never succeeded. Leaving Bigbasket. What the use of it when it is not able to provide service, when most needed.",1,2
"using this for almost 1 year. even after BBStar membership, slots are not available for last few days. even not geetting response from Cust Care chat and Call Center no is found not connectable.

Not able to place order Its showing delivery slot not available....,1,0
"First experience is always the best experience, but here in this case it was a very worst experience for me..at the homepage it says there is a slot available today however while checkout it says no available slots. This is very frustrating and wasting the customers time.",1,2

This is the worst app I have ever come across. I tried a booking for atleast 3 days with them saying that all the items are available but they are not finding any slots. How can someone not find any delivery slot for 3 days!!!!! I feel like giving it a 0 stars. I texted their customer support about thisand I RECEIVED NO REPLY!!!!! Isn't THAT AMAZING??,1,7
"I have given this app a hundred chances and waited patiently for them to react on situations. But its like thw app takes you for a ride, always delivers faulty products at rates higher than market. And in these difficult times it has reached a level wher they dont even respond to your woes. Star membership is namesake, slots are the only ones available as without membership.",1,0

Very bad experience. While ordaring u can see the products but then it get vanished .good way to fool people,1,0
All these fancy apps doesn't work during the crisis times. I have a bbstar membership and it is going to expire in 15 days and I was able to order only once during this lockdown. It always says slots are not available. I don't mind if items are delivered late but not allowing to order makes it frustrating. I have decided not to renew my membership and stick with the local store going forward.,1,60
"I am really sorry to say this.the basic functionality of the application is not working.i have never seen this kind of failure issue in my life.failure appliction design.i have order something on BB due to some internal issues i need to re-login into application, i am not able to login with my credentials it is saying error like account already exists.",1,3
Worst experience since 7 days I am trying to order stuff but I am not getting any slot n i am a bb star member which I think is useless. It shows next available slot but as soon as I add items it will appear as unfortunately we don't have any slot available for you right now. And daily they will room some stuff from my wallet.After complain they will right we are booked for next 7 days. I am also trying from so many days if I am not getting any slot how come other people are getting the slots?,1,3
I understand that because of lockdown there will be very less slots available but since last 2 weeks it's was showing there's no slot available and today i rechecked on the home screen it shows delivery slot available but at the time of checkout it shows an error saying that no slot available right now.

"Slot availability is just a big mess, inspite of your cart been filled up since weeks the minute you proceed to pay it say no slot available.

"Worst application, they always allow you to add everything in the basket and when the delivery come to you something is either missing or not available, to top it up when something from my order wasn't delivered to me they credited the amount to my big basket wallet and trust me this happened thrice, i then asked them to transfer that balance from the big basket wallet to the bank account card that i used to purchase my groceries, they haven't sent the balance as of yet its been 2 weeks",1,0
From past few days whenever we are trying to confirm the order it gives a msg saying slots not available...last week the app was crashing again and again...the Homepage shows the slot availablity but when we proceed further it given the same msg slots unavailable...if you are not in a position to serve the customer then stop the service.... upsetting,1,6
Worst shopping app. Every time it's shows no slot available from past 1 month. Everyone should uninstall this app. What is the use if they can't supply us during such situation. They should atleast show available slots with available dates but every time it shows all slots are full.,1,0
"Every time I try to login using my number, it says ""Number exists already"". What's the point of having OTP authentication when you can't even verify my own damn number? How am I supposed to login if the app never lets me. Very poorly designed app.",1,1
"Please for the sake of sanity open more slots ..been seeing the same no slots are available message for the past 2 Days now .. absolutely pathetic experience ..also where the heck is the exclusive slots for bbstar members offer , there's no point of these memberships when there's no slot available .. atleast show the possibile dates by when these slots might open up ..",1,1

"The vegetables are fruits are mostly in bad shape and stale. It started with bananas and then tomatoes and other vegetables. Don't buy vegetables which are much cheaper than market rate, most likely to be stale. The return request for perishable products vanishes automatically. The smaller rivals are doing a better job in vegetables and fruits. Other products are competitively priced and some good offers on cards and wallets. Shahrukh is just a face to hide reality.",1,23
"Am a regular customer, even a BB star member, what's the use of it if am not getting any help in this situation? It's been more than 2weeks probably am unable to find a single slot. Just need to uninstall this app. If I had option I would have given negative star or 0 star.",1,1
"I have not been able to place even a single order using your app in past one month.

Even the appsupport@bigbasket is not helpful, no response on this issue yet.",1,2
"Really bad experience. Especially having BBStar membership, the promised priority slot is never available. Customer support in non-responsive as ever.

"@bigbasket_com I have been using BigBasket for the last 8 years. But in these amazing circumstances (lockdown)not empty of your slot, whereas we are getting a new user slot around us. Now you do not need old customers, so I am also uninstalling your apps now. Thanks for your service.",1,0
"Most stupid app of all the e-commerce apps. All this time says ""all slots full - please try again later"". Is a person supposed to spend entire day looking at the app on when delivery slot opens up? I've used the app now for past 5 days and saw the slot open only twice, for probably an hour or so. Ridiculous. Waste of time",1,5
Waste of time and money app. After booking the item and during delivery they let us know that items most of the items are not available and deliver only 1 item of all booked by charging full delivery charges. They refund wallet and we have to end up using again in same app. Nice way to cheat people and rob money.,1,1
"This app is getting worse day by day 1.Payment offers are not available for even the most popular/premium cards/wallets.2. Delivery slot availability r incorrect,while placing it shows given slot is unavailable w/o suggesting available ones 3.product often gets out of stock n you get to know only while placing order.4. products options are very less,even most popular brands are unavailable 6.picking wrong delivery address even when a default address is set n it cant be changed for active order",1,1

I am also facing issue in the tricity panchkula regarding slots are not available. Could you please tell us when the slot will be available? At least you can share the future slot but it's only showing not available. This is very annoying and disappointing.

"I had been a BB star member, It has been 10 days and everyday still there is no slot available. The services are becoming really worst.Atleast show some slots for the future timing.

Utterly bad behaviour in the times of need.",1,1

Since Lockdown started Bigbasket is showing slots are full all the time and till now is not servicing in most of the parts. Where as Grofers started with limited slots to more slots and servicing gracefully. We decided to discontinue big basket and won't be using even after all is normal. If you can not support during crisis you are not supposed to be earning profit during normalcy.,1,5

Your team does not have a telephone to call and sort out , when you're unable to respond immediately ?",1,1
One of the worst app ever. Only BB Royal items are available to the Customers of Ahmedabad. Item costing is more than Market Value. Majority of Indian company products is not listed for sale. After Lockdown it is always showing Slots Full. Atleast slot opening timings is not mentioned. There is no alert for opening of slots. Not at all satisfied.,1,0
Pathetic app can't order anything failed message comes again and again I won't recommend this app to anyone when it can't be used in emergency times then what is it use.

BB has become a waste of time since out of 20 items nly 2 items r available (specially in nonveg items) but BB shws everything in stock n hence when u add non veg items to cart, suddenly 90% thing goes Out Of Stck",1,3
No delivery options available even after opted for BBStar membership. Not able to understand the reason for not accepting the booking. for Delivery I can understand the window but why limiting the shopping window between 8-10 am? This company still not came out of the mindset to understand between online and physical store. The worst app for shopping.,1,0
"Very disappointing app. I have mistakenly bought a product instead of another product, so i have being trying to return the product but they are not even responding for the msg. If i reporting to return the product means and on the next day it is disappearing. Very worst app.",1,2
I am trying from a week ago it is unavailable of slots and out of stock.if you do not have slots you have to show it at first only.now if you cannot deliver i will uninstall this app right now.first it said next slot will be from 6:00-8:00 and i saw at 6:00 it is showing next slots are on 29/3/2020 at 2:00-4:00 if you cannot deliver then why we should install this app.,1,3
"Home page shows the next available slot but during checkout it says no slots available. App says time slot changes depending on items in basket. I don't understand the logic behind that. Home page shows bigbasket has serviced 2.8 lac customer in one day. Well I wonder why they are patting themselves as it is a very lowly count if you consider the current situation and total number of bigbasket customers. In comparison, Amazon pantry is doing far better service in this situation than bigbasket.",1,1
"Worst feature- membership for priority slot without which you never get slots available also in such time of crisis. With it, you are lucky if you can check out in a single go. It has become frustrating.",1,1
"Very disappointed... it's a good app, no doubt about that maybe the price little high but still products availablity is good...But here is the thing that from last 9-10 days there is no slot available..are u kidding bigbasket... many people depend on u guys but what u give just disappointment...no no no u can't do that",1,0
"My experience with big basket has been quite awful I do not know if this has been due to the lockdown or not but i wasn't necessarily getting any slot space on groffers which I use regularly but they still do give some every now and then if you're a premium member of theirs of sorts and big basket pretty much made the same claim even during lockdown to get their membership to get priority slots however it's been 2 months almost I'm still waiting on their priority slot,waste of money.",1,2
"I have also taken membership of Big Basket, even then it never makes me available slot .its is a very worst app... slot is not available when the goods are available and the goods are not available when the slot is available😠",1,1
For me available slots are showing for tomorrow morning 8:30. But when I'm trying to place the order it says currently we don't have any available slots to service you. Please try again later. How could that be when it's showing available slots for tomorrow morning. Please fix the bug I'm facing,1,8
I have been trying to find slots since 10 days... This is very disappointing that when we need online services BB does not have slots for its customers ************** 4th may 2020 Its going to be a month since I'm trying to find slots to order. Dissatisfied with BB and never gonna order again...,1,0
Forcefully refunded amount in bigbasket wallet instead of origin payment method. Looting money from the customers! Update: No response from customer care in past 7 days. Officially uninstalling the app! Update 2: @bigbasket team: This is the second time I'm sharing the order details. I wish you could help me with my query with same speed as you reply to these ratings (feedbacks).,1,0
"Was very satisfied earlier, changed the rating today based on recent experiences. What I order doesn't gets delivered and I get the notification saying I returned them",1,0
This app has been such a disappointment during the lockdown. The standare delivery section shows some slot but I'm checking out all you get is no slots available..for the past 15 days this has been the case. So annoying to load a cart and then see the alert as delivery slots not available,1,0
What is the use when you can't serve the customers at this time? I'm getting the same message that you cannot provide service from 17th March. I will uninstall the app and will never return to BB. It is better to encourage the nearby Kirana Stores than purchasing at BB as they are readily available to serve in these hard times. There is no zero rating to leave so you guys get 1.,1,0
Worst app and worst customer experience.. Trying to add items to the same slot is not possible and even customer care is not able to help me.. After this order will uninstall the app.. After covid 19 it is showing slots but after adding products to basket no slots available and cant add items.. Guys dont install the app its worst customer service.. Already informed this to all my friends U will ask to mail Nobody will respond to mails Such a poor service Guys dont believe thes empathy statements,1,1
"i try this app for the first time really the worst experience, i went to order some products from the app. but when ever i open the app they say no slot available for your city, luckily one day i got the slot but when i go to the checkout all the products i have selected are out of stock so its a no use app for me. i say dont waste your time. either you don't get the slot or you dont get anything at all.",1,2
"Since past 1 month the app shows slot available on home page. But as soon as we click on checkout it says no alot avaialble. Tiered of reporting this to Bigbasket. Their customer care service is so pathetic. Sometimes they say slots will open 11 AM every day, try at that time. Somestimes at 5 PM every day. I already uninstalled app. All other e commerce sites are delivering in my area. But Bigbasket is so poor and not able to deliver in my area.",1,9
"Since the starting of lockdown the app has been showing "" ALL SLOTS FULL.Please try later"". 50 days into the lockdown and still u guys can't manage it. A Big thumbs down. Other such operaters like grofers and bigbazar online resolved these issues after having delivery issues for the first few days of the lockdown..but these guys are still grappling....",1,2
I have almost more than 30 items in my basket and one can see the slots are available for delivery. But when I click to proceed further it denies saying that the slot isn't available. I'm not sure why this is happening and I'm a bit upset with this. Not a good service.,1,4
I didn't find this app beneficial at all.. Due to good reviews from ma fellow colleagues in past made me install this app bt turns out a huge disappointment.. Experiencing not availability of slots since d time I have registered on bb. Don't get uo hopes high especially in current situation.,1,2
"Worst app ever. For one product help, I am keep on messaging them from almost 10 days. But no reply from the bot or customer care. Unless you need this app, recommended is not to use. Pathetic customer support. Many of my friends are also facing this issue. Poor management and poor products. Like ladyfingers, cabbage, mushrooms. Never recommend to anyone to use",1,4
From past three days I am trying to buy vegetables and other essentials.when they are no slots..y the hell bb open ?better say we r closed...kept on refreshing... understand current situation...if no slots available for days together then no use of this app...I am uninstalling...Amazon fresh is helpful,1,0
Slot are available but still unable to order. If that slot is not available for my location then app should not display it. Better to create a queue of orders which will be visible to user in that location. So that he choose to order from big basket or go for other options.,1,1
"Unhappy with ""no slots available"" .it's been a month ,if you can't provide the service due to some other reason you should have furnished the same. A lot of time is been wasted for checking slots.",1,0

"Since the time lockdown started, not once I could get a slot to order items.. everytime I open the app, ""slots are not currently"" available is the message I get to see. Their daily updates is always the same, that they are working on it. Kab slots milenge Bhai? Lockdown khatam hone ke baad?",1,0
"It has been 2 days since big basket announced that it's operational in Hyderabad also during lockdown, a message was shown that deliveries will now be accepted. However, even now there are no available slots, and when trying to checkout I am being shown the alert- 'Something went wrong'. I have taken bbstart membership yet there is no difference in the delivery slot availability!",1,4
"Horrible app....always says ""loading please wait"" on whatever i click on. Even on a 150mbps 5g wifi connection. Plus half of the images r blank & not loading. Many clicks lead to a network error dialogue. How do u expect customers to shop easily when the main interface is so inconvenient.",1,5
"App is good for shopping. But frustrated with the way customer support is handled. I want to contact them for issues I am facing, but there is no contact number or email id in app. Only help topics with predefined questions and answers..I have issues which are not mentioned there. So what should I do. 1) didn't get Paytm cash back even after weeks. 2) always removing items from cart just a few hours before delivery. If you can't deliver, then why are you accepting the order.",1,0
"Each and every item is highly over priced. Grofers/ Amazon Pantry serves you far better. You can find groceries for cheaper rates than this at your local grocery store. And slots being never available 😂 is it a joke ? Subscribe to BB star membership to get priority slots ! 😂 What kinda a business are you guys doing ? Just wanted to try you guys out for once, Never getting back again. 😊",1,0
Useless app ...even after opting for membership they don't allow to shop... It's been 2 weeks I am in need of items and have been trying to checkout....

"Pathetic service & useless app. I have been trying to order for the last 2 days to no avail. Customer service doesn't respond to messages and closes the service request without any communication and resolution. Tried calling customer service twice but the wait time is not less than 25 minutes. This is one of the hopeless apps in this time of crises. They say special/priority slots are allotted to BB Star customers. I bought it and still it didn't work. This app is a scam, needs to be reported.",1,2
I downloaded the app and funded the wallet. I also paid Rs.300 for premium account. However I am not able to make any purchase due to lockdown nor I am able to withdraw money from the wallet. There is no provision to withdraw money. There no way that you can communicate with big basket. It's full cheating. Please be careful before transferring money to wallet. If you transfer forget about your money.,1,3

"What good is the app if it fails in times of crisis? I am a BB star member since long and I have not been able to place a single order since this outbreak. Really goes to show the apps robustness and BigBaskets commitment to its customers. Never using it again, even if things improve.",1,3
Waiting for slots to order groceries from more than a week. Never able to see slot available.Why can't you fix a time daily for slots availablity with limited orders similar to how Bookmyshow is providing timeslots for Bye-One-Get-One movie tickets for ICICI Credit Card offer. Please check this suggestion so that everyone will get a chance to order groceries.,1,1
"I am tring slot for last 5 days, it shows some slot on 1st screen, after adding items it take you to cart and remove items as per availability, then finally before payment show no stot available. Happening since last 5 days daily, if no slot is available show in 1st page itself",1,0

"Worst experience. Not recommended. I placed an order for BB Popular rice - 25kg couple of weeks ago and I received a sealed rice bag. We opened the rice bag couple of days ago and the bag was full of insects. UNACCEPTABLE. I have raised the issue to the bb application but there is no response regarding this.

"For last 1 and 1/2 months it has been showing not slots available whenever I'm trying to purchase anything. It seems they are jocking with customers. This has a mockery of online shopping.

From March 2020 I have tried so many times to order but everytime slots not available. I have tried different times but everytime slot not available. That's why m cancel my membership. If big basket not provide member proity . Then how can I paid member ship amount . Last 25 days I am so disappointed from big basket service .,1,1
Tried from few months to still now.. Always showing slots full.. It is bad experience in this pendemic period.. In this period only its very important to get service.. But its too bad from big basket,1,2

We are losing our valuble time ...added lot of item to basket and when going to check out, it is showing unavailable or temporarily unable.",1,3
"Firstly, I find no slots at the time of checkout when I see next slot showing in the home tab. What does it supposed to mean when I spend time adding to the cart and not able to purchase? Secondly, falsely providing notification that I will get bb membership free but I see 299 when I opt for membership. Is'nt that unfair to lure customers unethically ? Thirdly most of items not in stock. Is'nt this a common scenario to remove such items from catalogue rather than showing it in product list ?",1,3
"Very bad app. During these hard times, the app shows slot for delivery but when u try to check out basket it says unfortunately no delivery slots available. Again go on home page and there still it has slot available. Extremely poor on bigbaskets part to trouble customer by doing such thing",1,1

This was the first time i downloaded your app spending my data and i have to wait for slots? Why didn't you mention that u are anyways not going to let people order. I wouldn't have downloaded this stupid app then. I even waited a week to get a slot but no service. Gonna uninstall right now,1,0
Trying to order from past 1 week. In the front page it says slot available and on trying to check out it's slot unavailable. Every hour slots keep on updated but won't accept orders. Few times it goes through and I get few items not available on removing and trying to reorder the slots are not available. If you are not able to deliver please don't give false hope in getting grocery delivery at this time.,1,0

Worst app. Kind of fraud to take money and not give any slot. I had funded wallet and from 2 weeks didn't get a single slot ready. It's fraud to promise a guarantee delivery for bb membership and when subscribed you don't give a slot even forget about the delivery. You are definitely minting money in lockdown and covering up as if doing a social service.,1,0
"The service of big basket is very worst. Synchronization of system with available item is very bad. Even a item is stocked out, they show it in app and after placing of order they it is not available. There after the money get refund to bigbasket wallet instead of bank account. Moreover, they don't deliver in mentioned slot. As a result I could not receive the order. Very worst service ever. It has no contact point for query. Contact number is not available. Groofers is far better than it.",1,0

Waste Of Money With this App. They Say Fresh Items and When I recieved I got damaged products and beetroot was dry and damaged.

Very bad support during the time of crisis.The true purpose of BB of getting home delivery at the time of need is not being fulfilled. For last 4-5 days all I am see is slot being full. After more than 15 attempts only once in the recent 10 days I got an delivery. Suddenly the item is not available or the price gets changed or slot is full.

"The ""No questions asked"" return policy makes big basket better above all others. But that doesn't mean that they should be delivering worst quality products and effectively making me return most of the order and thus inconveniencing me even more. The frozen is not at all frozen.

I have to give this rating as cannot give below 1..very bad app..since 3 days its showing slots full. Very bad app. If all slots are full then why aren't tgey just closing this app. Such waste of time. I almost selected evertrhing I wanted to order and then it showed all slots full.,1,2

"Pathetic to see that during these testing times these guys @ big basket are testing us. Waited four days after adding items to cart assuming the slots will open. Realised only now that it's a gimmick that these guys are doing, Instead of updating the items unavailability they just let the user add the unavailable item to the cart and never allot a delivery slot to that cart. Wasted four days and now my area is sealed. Atleast I could have tried some alternatives instead of false hope. Shame.",1,1

"Horrible in one word!!! It takes money for item 3 days before use it as their money earns and then when time comes for delivery it simply cancel at the end moment, the status was shown as packed and then when the time slot is over it cancel.

Worst service and stupid app. Never showed a slot. Always the slots are full. I've been trying to order since March when lockdown began.

There are many products u can add in ur basket in this app but unfortunately u cannot buy those.. some times apps shows next available slot as some day but then when u checkout says sorry u have no slots available...

Even if the slots are showing as available in front page, whole trying to checkout, it shows as 'No slot available'. I have been spending almost 2-3 hrs on the app everyday just to order essentials.

"Waste app, they never delivers your complete items and refunds the money for undelivered items in the wallet so that you have to purchase next time from them only and when go again to utilize the wallet money they will charge the delivery amount and will not deliver the complete item list again.

"Vegetables seemed to be less than the local shop I buy , but it's not true . Here are reasons I don't like big basket online orders. 1.

No effort was done to deliver the same. 3. Not delivered items money will sit in wallet , which is a considerable amount indirectly forcing you to place next order and repeating same.",1,0
Big basket has became irritating hotspot. Then they show you delivery slots available but when you proceed for payment app tells you delivery slot no longer available.

In recent times the big baskets quality of products as well as service has deteriorated significantly. They cancel and reschedule orders at their whims.

I hate ordering from big basket now. Today was my last order never again. In a pandemic situation they still don't care about lives of their customers . The orders are not packed and they don't bring it to your doorstep. My order was left open on the lift floor all the items loose no packaging. If the items are not packed in paper bags or any kind of recyclable bags the loose open items should not be handled in such a manner.

Doesn't even deserve single star. Absolutely pathetic service !!! Had to cancel order twice as system was picking wrong location. Refund of money takes 7-9 working days.

Fraudulent refund policy. Items always out of stock The app lets you place orders for items that always go out of stock. The refund always goes back to bb wallet and not to the original mode of payment which is an outright fraud. I have availed their membership as well. But no benefits. Recommend to use amazon or grofers rather than this,1,2
"Used to be great but in the past couple of months, it's like playing a guessing game. Order 15 things and guess how many would get delivered, how many would be rotten and how many would actually be usable. More ofter than not, the last number is lower than the other two",2,78
"Slots availability continues to be an issue. There is no notification system that informs you when a delivery slot is available. The app basically relies on the user opening it 3-4 times a day and hoping to get lucky. Issues with availability of items are plenty. Quality of vegetables and fruits is horrible. They don't accept Sodexo cards (not slips, cards). Frankly, if it weren't for the lockdown, I would be happy to drive down to the market and not rely on BB at all.",2,281

If the products are not available it should be synced with database so that we do not see if on the app portal. Everytime during delivery some products are missing, but I see that are still tagged as ""available"" on the portal. Good service, timely delivery, etc. are the positives. However if you deliver 6 out of 10 items everytime and do a refund, does not that defeat the very purpose of me buying from you?",2,173
Impressed with the collection of groceries and vegetables. But the quality is way to bad. The chlorine taste is all over the fruits. The vegetables quality is the very bad. Initially I had rated 5 based on the app experience but had to change it. This is not the 1st time I am facing it. I think the warehouse in my area is not up to the mark. I doubt I would order anything from Big Basket ever again. Good Bye Big Basket! The hunt for new app begins.,2,75
Hi I am a member of BB... The issue is while I was going the list of veggies n fruits I just got 88 opti ons available in the app and the same time in the other phone it showed 169 products available for a non member...

"Once Upon a Time bb Used to be Good! In COVID times, the bb actually cheated by not honouring Star Membership in Lucknow even during Unlock phases when 11 online services were delivering in the are, right from Amazon to Swiggy to PayTm to Spencer and off late, OnDoor. The customer support engages with the the customers as BOTS, templated replies and acting dumb. My four & half month subscription bb has 'gulped without a burp'! Even if you're using it's services, don't opt for its membership ‼️",2,1
"I have been using big basket with bbstar membership . However there is a big flaw in there operations, it is of no use when you need the most. During lockdown and even now most of the time you will find slot not available, If I have to depend on my local kirana stores in my dire need then what is the use of big basket?? So my experience is it is not at all dependable when you need most??",2,168
"Although the app front page is showing slots as available, on checkout it is giving error for 'no slots available' I have already done 'clear data/cache' number of times in past 2-3 days .. but this just keeps happening...

"Products wise, good and vast variety of products are available in reasonable price . Delivery timing and packaging is also ok. One thing is that i am disappointed with the membership. The big basket membership is just wasted. Never got reserved slots, instead one month was extended, but whats the use because when i require slots its hardly available .",2,4
The app is miserable since long. 8 out of 10 times online payment will not go through & you have to wait for the pay option to appear against the order to complete your payment. One more bug - it showed me the total payable amount as Rs.70 and so I first went and top-up my FreeCharge wallet by Rs.70. Then when I attempted to make the payment it showed me the payable amount as Rs.70.10 and I had to again top up the FreeCharge wallet by Rs.1. Like this there are several bugs in the App.,2,8

I mean what's the benifit using this app or website if i dont get a single slot available once a week!!!",2,13
The very problem is the availability of slots.While checkout it almost always shows that slots are not available.But for some people slots are there (for the same address). Dont know if it is a bug issue or management issue.But it needs to be fixed.Its frustrating.Now is the time when people try to get things delivered in their homes.,2,59

"The payment system is extremely confusing. The cust rep also failed to answer my query. There is no option to pay online using Sodexo. And it's not clear how do I pay for the remaining items which are not covered by Sodexo. And to top it all, the system generated a COD payment while the customer rep said they are not accepting any COD !!! What to do?",2,0
"After doing emails slots were available. I got the slot immediately and had placed my order. But in a hurry I placed a wrong item, which I need to return and also place a fresh order instead with many more items. After chatting with three guys continuously in their help and support system place and also called them, they have some rules due to the present situation, it is not possible to return or exchange any item. Which they should have mentioned while we order and place the items.",2,2
Worst app experience...products are ok but the app is bad....the search option is the worst...you cannot search a particular product and sorting is also not possible....the items doesn't sort by price or any other drop-down items....in short the developers are not working properly to remove the bugs.,2,1
Slot availability is still an issue as the app doesn't give any notification when the slots are available. It's quite inconvenient. Needs to work on that. The collection is fine but vegetable and fruit quality is not good.,2,3
All slots full for last 15 days..checked several times a day...I wonder as to who are those people managing to get a slot for them..looks like BB has stopped operating in the area. Or may be it's a bug.,2,3
You might have added 20 items. Because of one item in your list slot may not be able. Now you need to remove one by one from your cart to find that unavailable item. Such a pathetic app. Why can't the app detect and tell you which item is causing you unavailable slot?,2,4
Everything is fine about the app But I think the guys the way you are delivering is not good .The items should be separately packed so that items can not be contaminated I can see delivery boy touches every time without using hand golves and I think it's not good ..Try to make every package in safely packed so that no one can touch our things Every thing about app is fine and please make sure that you delivery is up to mark,2,1
The app is not working. I am not able to add any item to the cart or delete an existing item.,2,0
"The problem that I had reported earlier, still holds. For the past 15 days, no slots have been made available in my area. I've grown tired of waiting, and complaining as well. And what I have realised is, this is a very deliberate and calculative move by BigBasket. They are simply waiting for the prices of the different products to shoot up. While I have been waiting for slots to be made available in my area, the prices of the products in my cart have gone up massively. STOP THIS NONSENSE..!!",2,2
User experience is not great. Order gets confirmed without even paying. Always getting popup something went wrong from our end. Make it more user friendly and fix these glitches.,2,1

I placed a order at a certain price broadcasted on your app and later on there is a price hike or god knows what charges and there is addition of that price hike or negative balance on my next order. This is ridiculous and worst experience for a first time user. If you display a price...you are bound to acknowledge that price..so bad services,2,5
I am really disappointed. I used to shop from bb since last year but this year after the outbreak of Covid everytime I found that the slots are full. Its just seems useless for me.,2,2
"App is misguiding consumers about available slots,everyday they will show specific slot time and when we check that time even 2 hours before the prior announced slot they show next day slot. instead give right information to consumers.",2,1
Glitchy app. The add address option is such a waste. It adds addresses and then skips out details on its own. Plus the delivery date is all messed up. Shows something once and shows a very different date in the end.,2,2
Slot system is an awful and disturbing system which is shown always to the apps. Since three days I can find any slot then I how can I depend on this app to buy anything? Fix the prb.,2,2
"Nowadays no discount on MRP of most of the items: sometimes charges more than MRP!Too long delivery slot. For early delivery have to pay addnl delivery charges. Packs like Nescafe, no mrp is printed, hence charge whatever mrp. Apple pack is under weight by 100 GM's. Lodged complaint with photo of the weight of the pack, but no one attended.

"Good products, quick delivery everything is fine, except for the payment and refund system. Once I forgot to apply a promo code while ordering, was also unable to apply promo after ordering. So I thought I'd cancel the order and reorder after applying the promo. Surprisingly, the refund was deposited in the bbwallet after cancellation. So I had to order again using the wallet cause the money in the wallet can't be used anywhere except bigbasket. So once you order you won't get any real refund.",2,0

Don't try. Instead finish your original Order (1) and for missed items add separate Order (2). BB deliver only second Order they may miss the first one.

After 15 days no use of cancelling the membership as well. So in that period they made a very good delivery and products also are good.. but after that there will be no response, just they will say sorry..",2,18
Still you guys haven't improved on Return/Refund features. The option to open gallery and send photos while chating with Customer representative is so bad. Do you guys even look at those options?

It was good but recently they have started charging cancelation fees. I don't have a problem with cancelation fee if order was placed properly. But if payment fails for some reason not under my control why charge a cancelation fee. I may not have enough cash and I don't want to spend 1 hour resolving the issue. Another problem is if they do not deliver the item they refund to wallet and not to card. Why place the order and then try to take payment? Do not take the order if payment fails first.,2,4

Items were delivered at the ground floor security table. They were not bundled into one pack and were scattered on the table everywhere and got mixed with deliveries.",2,0
I was a regular user of BB and in current situation i m getting msg slots are not available. Whats the use of being its regular user if its not available for old users. They should come up with something to make sure serving its old user atleast once in this hard time. I will not forget the BB didnt come up with any plan to serve its users in hard time once its over.,2,9
Even when slots are available the bookings are not allowed . Can you please explain what is the issue ? If slots were not available then the situation is understandable but when its available then whats the issue ? Using big basket since 3 years but never faced an issue . I tried reaching your customer care and tgey said will call back in half an hour but their call never came.,2,5
"I need to keep an eye on this app to avail the delivery slots which I can understand. But sometimes before the delivery date I got notifications that some products not available whereas those products are still available.

I liked this app but the reason to set it to two is... I am trying to book the order from one week onwards and always I am getting slots are full. I can understand the current situation. But If this is the case when can others book the order... And is it not possible to include like a token system so that other people also will get a chance? Thanks,2,27
"Why do I always get that slots are not available...I don't even understand it..I cant even buy a single item from it.....the rates and offers are good (that's why the two stars or else I wouldn't have given them) but it is of no use cuz I can't even buy them cuz the slots are full😤..plz have a look into it, and make it quick.☹ It will be really good if the slots are available soon..other than that👍",2,3
"The app has glitches. When I add items like bread and cookies, fresh fruits, shampoo, on checkout, message flashes no slots available even though home page says slots are there. When these items are removed, I can proceed to checkout page. Moreover, same thing is happening if I am trying to order more than 10 items. So there is no way I can be a ""caring shopper who can buy stuff for 3-4 weeks"" if the app won't let me checkout with the required items.",2,200
Very poor execution. Firstly I select my product... Because it's appears to be available and when I proceed to checkout it's shows items out of stock. Very disappointing... Please fix the issue or rather show the items which are ACTUALLY in stock rather than focusing on customer base. Also items which show availability .... Somehow have no delivery slot available just during checkout. It's time consuming as well as creates a wrong impression. It's happened more than once.,2,1

Since last few weeks whenever I open this app I get the message all slots are full. It also gives message more than 70% or even 90% customers are serviced but I never get the slot. I am not sure how is this possible that u never get slot. I tried at different times of the day including mid night but no use. I hv sent the mail with my contact details as well,2,44
The service is good but app sucks. Could you please update the app for below - 1. Filter or sort items based on availability. 2. Do not remove items from list if unavailable. Rather those can remain in basket for next order until customer removes. 3. Option to remove items which were marked for notification. It's possible that notification not needed any longer after some time.,2,4
"Very disappointing app. Very very unhelpful. You spend a lot of time, picking up the items and putting them in the basket.

But after shifting to Hyderabad, I find that Big basket in third rate",2,32

I also mentioned i am fine with the order being delivered next day. But they cancelled the order .",2,0
The items booking is quite ambiguous. Even if the item is available while booking but after that there is no guarantee that the item is delivered. Ordered many times and many important items though available at the time of booking become unavailable right before delivery. And if I try to cancel the order because of item unavailability I have to pay the extra price. The app owners should take responsibility when the orders are cancelled because of item unavailability.,2,3
"I liked the app and also heard about its efficacy. But ""no slots are available..plz try later""--this message is irritating me for so long.

Delivery is good but the biggest issue that we face is when the slots are available the items get out of stock and when items are in stock the slots are full .. this is such an endless cycle which will never end .

Your slot system is unpredictable. Difficult to order and most of them are out of stock. Wasting time and 1 or 2 product get cancelled form order and money will be credited to wallet for re-order.

It's been a month we are looking for the slot but can't get the slot..In this current scenario atleast you should give everyone slot so no one has to wait for their turn or you can use app engagement n see who is visiting you app number of times so accordingly you can give slots.

This app shows wrong information about the available stock. While placing order it shows the stock is available and tells the items are reserved.

Used it in banglore service is good. In Pune its pathetic. It will show that this is your next available slot the moment you check out it says sorry we have no slots to service you and if u go and check back it will still show you slot is available but you cannot order.

I think it's a waste of time to select things on this app when you don't want to deliver instead of showing the available slots. It's been 2nd week since I am trying to place an order but it's not allowing me to pay and showing that the slots are not available whereas the drop down shows available slots. If it's only for bb star priority customers then it should be mentioned in the application before installation.,2,1

Terrible experience in the time of lockdown. They don't tell you if some items are not available and they just send a message and keep the money in their wallet. They should refund the money via same payment mode atleast. They don't even attempt to redeliver missing items.,2,0

"Big Basket repeatedly cancel the items citing them as unavailable *after* you have paid for them. I can understand if they cancel before billing saying that a certain item is not available. But once we have reserved the item (by paying for it) how can they be ""unavailable"". This raises serious questions about their inventory management. The argument of spoiled goods doesn't hold for non-perishables like nappies. Worse, they will refund it to BB Wallet forcing to return to BB.",2,0

Be assured of.missing items in your order deliveries. They will take order but then at last minute not deliver some of the items citing unavailability. Amazing how a tech driven platform can manage their inventory so poorly. Also quality of vegetables is mix with some fresh and some stale. Some items like ice cream are as old as an year. Overall their reliability and quality has gone down in last 6 months.,2,1

Can someone at Big basket please help users like us?",2,0
After putting items in basket it does not allow to select a slot. Although in Home screen it says that slot is available. Misleading people during time of need.

"The overall model for ordering is immature. You can book products ,but at the time of delivery you may find some items missing because they are not available. Then they will transfer the difference back to you by wallet as default . So 2 things . 1.

You should give choice to customer to decide where he or she needs the refund to be made ,rather than defaulting it to BBwallet.",2,0

Recently I have been disappointed with few of my last interactions with this app. First of all I never find slots available for ordering now a days. Today when I placed an order all the things that I ordered was in stock and suddenly I was called and told that some items are unavailable. The worst part why fo you refund the money in BB wallet? If you are not able to deliver my products then why are you locking my money? The app stays in my phone till I use my BB cash. Changing my review 5* to 2*,2,0

They have lots to learn and i dont want to be their guinea pig. Uninstalling the app.",2,0
I just installed the app and checked out for groceries and daily requirements. I was shocked to see the rates provided by the store. All the rates are 25- 30% costlier than the D Mart and Reliance Market. This is just glamour app for big shots.,2,0

"I love big basket. The company excels in stock, prompt on-time delivery and problem resolution. What it does not excel in, is app design. The BB app is so slow that I think I will become a vegetable by the time my groceries basket finally loads. Simply navigating between categories is such a task, that I mentally cut my list short eliminating things I am sure I could do without waiting for, right now. I am fed up of home and have been considering moving out, but no one has inspired me more than Big Basket. No matter how many times I set my location to Mumbai, it goes back to Koramangala Bengaluru, where I have never lived in my whole life. Even after I put my pin exactly where I live, it detects a different district. A great app to test your patience, and trim your shopping list. Why do I just not use the web app? Hint: the mobile app is better.",2,0
We will not get products ordered everytime one or the other item will be missing and for Dog food which ordered recently manufactured on Feb 2020 already 6 months has been passed for the product and why we dont have latest manufacturing pet food.

there are two major problems in the app. 1st priority delivery slots: being BB star member I have never able to use priority slots. once I talked to customer care and he told me that there are so many BB members so that they are running out of priority slots. 2nd Save for later/wishlit option: second there should be save for later/wishlist option in the cart just like Flipkart or Amazon. so that I can save my products for later purchase.,2,0
"It is so irritating that since the past 10 days it shows, no slots available or sometimes my order is placed and then the next day they will cancel it. And they keep showing the numbers, to how many households they have delivered in one day, cool, what shud I do of that?",2,4
"This app lets you add items even though they are not in stock and at the checkout asks you to modify the order, how lame! Then after placing order they inform some of the items are not available.

Even after patiently trying for an available delivery slot for over 6 days no delivery slots available. Items added to the cart when available in stock automatically get removed at checkout and have to do it all over again a dozen times. Ultimately did not serve the purpose as I am still in urgent need of groceries and no company willing to deliver.,2,0
I order groceries and half the items don't get delivered. This is really irritating. How is it possible that while ordering an item it shows that it is available and on the day of delivery it shows that the product is unavailable? Not happy with your service. We're always wondering what will get cancelled at the last moment.,2,0
Big basket is not genuine. How??see BB had told in August that if you shop 1500 by Citi card you will get 500 after 90 days. Now Citi has credited only 362. Why?? No answer. Or we are fooled by Citi to read term and condition. This is not genuine. Now also same type of scheme is running be careful to deal with this type of scheme,2,5
"First of all, the items are expensive here. Secondly there are multiple issues in the app. When you select an item, and try to place the order, it say item out of stock, and when you click on notify me, it says item in stock, and this has happened multiple time in the month of April and May 19.

"Too many notifications and there is no option to mute them (except the phone's own settings). It wouldn't be bad if the notifications were about orders or other important things.

Edit: No I'm not emailing you in private, I'm going to leave a review so that other people can benefit too. 1. Stop spamming ads 2. Make choosing the express delivery reliable",2,317
big basket is a good grocery app in terms of the products available but i had a very bad experience with it. they provide with discounts and offers for just name sake. they provide free products with certain amount of shopping which is always out of stock. they add the product on their own and durimg checkout it is always out of stock. also they provide high discount for product but do not deliver the product. i added a gel nail paint with 55% off but they won't deliver it,2,0

I am a priority member and this is my observation: 1. Delivery in a day for priority members. But this still very slow compared to Amazon fresh. 2. Most of the popular items are almost always unavailable. 3. Highly priced-- e.g. Aashirwad 10 kg is almost 7-8% more compared with Amazon or Grofers. 4.hardly any benefits for priority members. Discounts are only on almost useless items. Both Amazon and Grofers are far better. 5. Poor pricing and discounting strategies.,2,0
"In each and every app first you make the payment and then your order gets confirmed if it's not COD. But this app is faulty as it does just the opposite. So if you have any payment related issue, your order will get confirmed. Then you have to cancel your order which is chargeable. Secondly if you use your wallet money you won't be able to use any promos. Why? Wallet money is my money. Then how do I use it? Ultimately if you wish to use your wallet money then you need to forego your promo",2,0
Worst part with me it that its after applying first order DISCOUNT CODE or coupon it's show discount price to pay but at final payment asked to pay full amount and even after declining payment it automatically converted into COD . there is few options for cancellation and if you cancel you need to pay even for that on your next transaction ... Worst experience Its has many false and automatically changes,2,0
"Ever since lockdown facing a lot of problems regarding delivery slots and now your token system is worst of them all. It is very difficult for customers to get a delivery slot through this system, waiting for 2 days, called thrice but no help, remember at this time of recession one customer is also important and if he or she is a bbstar customer, if you are unable to give a slot then the items in the cart also become unavailable soon, haven't you think about this. Very disheartening.",2,0
Bigbasket is very nice and helpful app but I'm disappointed from there packaging of the product. Because i ordered some groceries from it and the product was laying on the floor and i am counting it. No paper bag or box it was standardless delivery of the product. Because this is not my first online shopping. I have ordered so many things from the other app and they have sensed in the box that is the standard delivery not just the product laying down on the floor. But the product was good. 👌👍,2,10
complete disaster application. it does not save your preference if you change your address. so had to go altogether to complete new list inorder to order. lot of other small issues. i dont know if they will be addressed ever. switching to some other application for order.,2,1

"delivery options are not available and customer support is useless,rather they will just reply""you will not face problem again"" that never happens you keep facing problem again and again. Star membership is useless you get additional discount but delivery options are just for namesake for star members, No prefrence untill you do some minimum purchase. Dmart /big bazar / star bazar are way better to buy stuff then these guys. atleast you can complain and get issues resolved there .",2,0
Not happy with the quality of service,2,0
They confirm your order and deliver only what they please - Stating unavailability of items - They are not efficient to let you know while placing the order.. Sometimes they just don't deliver the most important items from your order and they won't even give you a one time free delivery for the rest of the items - All they have to offer is an apology.. If you want a free delivery for the item you didn't receive - Order for 1200 again !,2,0

First of all the rating page pops up just after the order is placed n disappears after the actual delivery which is deliberate. I had ordered 2 boxes of chicken one of which was expired n the packaging for the other was was torn. Ever since i start d using bb i have always had issues which had to be fixed by calling them up however i have reached my vit's end and felt the need to pen down these things. Ofcourse they did offer me a refund but my plans for lunch were ruined; dissappointing.,2,2

I've been an avid user of bb since last year but offlate their quality of products + availability + USE OF PLASTIC IS forcing me to consider options. Here are some issues based on my experience: - Undelivered items: available and billed for but not delivered. Over a long term you end up placing multiple orders and its not very pocket friendly or time efficient - Horrible quality: especially with their precopped veggies and use of plastic + there's often no option to select whole veggies,2,0

Bigbasket apps should be more user friendly like Swiggy.

service is alright except for perishables. fresh vegetables are sometimes frozen and they mix bad ones with good ones which otherwise people can pick and choose at a vendor. more so if the weight increases even by a little but they charge the customer (even as minimum as ₹1) but mix bad product with good which you end up discarding. all in all you get lesser value and pay more. shelf life of veggies and fruits is just 2 days so cant buy for the whole week. and fruits go bad instantly.,2,0

I've been an avid user of bb since last year but offlate their quality of products + availability + USE OF PLASTIC IS forcing me to consider options. Here are some issues based on my experience: - Undelivered items: available and billed for but not delivered. Over a long term you end up placing multiple orders and its not very pocket friendly or time efficient - Horrible quality: especially with their precopped veggies and use of plastic + there's often no option to select whole veggies,2,0

I am a priority member and this is my observation: 1. Delivery in a day for priority members. But this still very slow compared to Amazon fresh. 2.

Discounts are only on almost useless items. Both Amazon and Grofers are far better. 5. Poor pricing and discounting strategies.,2,0

What is the meaning of delivering incomplete order & that is the case of almost every order I've placed till date in last 4-5 months. Why they take the order if they don't have that product in stock..!! There might be some really important item, for which customer is waiting..and at the last moment they found that missing. Really hopeless service BigBasket",2,0

"It was an unpleasant experience. First app suggested to transfer the money in their wallet. After that when we wanted to book the orders, slots were not available. Finally, after trying for many days, we got the delivery slot. But delivery process was pathetic. There was no intimation about the delivery time and actual delivery. Items were delivered at the ground floor security table. They were not bundled into one pack and were scattered on the table everywhere and got mixed with deliveries.",2,0
"Big basket never delivers all the items, they purposely keep one or 2 items not available , but they inform only on the day of delivery. The item which is not delivered is never fully refunded, they deduct the money showing that the vegetables & fruits which has been ordered have increased in weight & they always deduct the money from the item which is not delivered. So purposely one or 2 item is kept pending to deduct the money.",2,0

Most of the products are out of stock. Service day by day detoroid.,2,0
This app shows wrong information about the available stock. While placing order it shows the stock is available and tells the items are reserved. But you won't get all the products at the time of delivery. And the refund will go to the wallet instead to bank account from where you paid. It's trap!,2,1

Recently I have been disappointed with few of my last interactions with this app. First of all I never find slots available for ordering now a days. Today when I placed an order all the things that I ordered was in stock and suddenly I was called and told that some items are unavailable. The worst part why fo you refund the money in BB wallet? If you are not able to deliver my products then why are you locking my money? The app stays in my phone till I use my BB cash. Changing my review 5* to 2*,2,0
"The service is going down, the ordered products are cancelled frequently my previous three orders speak for itself and the delivery spots hard to get understandably due to lockdown, there is no benefit to star members nowadays.

Ok,2,0
It was good but recently they have started charging cancelation fees. I don't have a problem with cancelation fee if order was placed properly. But if payment fails for some reason not under my control why charge a cancelation fee. I may not have enough cash and I don't want to spend 1 hour resolving the issue. Another problem is if they do not deliver the item they refund to wallet and not to card. Why place the order and then try to take payment? Do not take the order if payment fails first.,2,4

Very bad site. I have never received my order to full. It takes so much time in searching and adding things to cart. And when receiving the order you realise half the items are missing.

Big Basket charges for cancelling the order even after being a star customer. This is ridiculous. No order home delivery app like amazon does that. If a customer wants to cancel his order why should he pay for cancellation. Big basket should stop this as this extra burden on the customers. If cancellation charges are not removed I am going to discontinue using this app.,2,0
The app as such is ok but you cannot change anything from the order after you place it. Even the address and you need to pay a cancellation fee if you need to change anything and that is plus the delivery for a delivery that is being cancelled and hence will not be delivered.,2,1

Not good vegitable and fruit.,2,0
"Its really disappointing that according to your system at the time of delivery only customer comes to know that few of his order is not delivered even they are given a slot next day or later. It might be that missing items are of prime necessity. Might it happens that customer could have not ordered. Over it you keep the paid amount for the missing item to the wallet and customer have to reorder paying again the delivery charges. Though you have option ""out of stock"" so why this hassle?",2,0

"They don't deliver all items you select and pay for. My second order had 7 of 8 and third had 4 of 8 delivered. When you pay everything is available but on delivery date some items become unavailable. Even with covid it shouldn't happen. Imagin if you booked 4 train tickets and on travel date irctc tell you that 2 births are now unavailable! I guess if Big basket paid their backend team and app developers better rather than spending on marketing with superstars, they will have better product.",2,0
Payment methods not user friendly. Should learn from Amazon.,2,0
Bigbasket is doing good in terms of timely delivery. But the problem is they are not refunding the amount for cancelled items. Sometimes they again ask for amount in the name of cash on delivery even though we have paid through online.,2,0

It's been a month we are looking for the slot but can't get the slot..In this current scenario atleast you should give everyone slot so no one has to wait for their turn or you can use app engagement n see who is visiting you app number of times so accordingly you can give slots.

The delivery was fine. But I have issue with tje servicing! They presented with an offer that stated I will get 200 cash back in my wallet after 1k purchase! But I didn't get it.

Just don't give these fake offers if u can't provide the stated terms. Thank you!,2,0
This is a very helpful app .. but there are few things that bothered me here..it takes 2-3 days for delivery and then it cancels your products by it's own and the refund is generated in big basket wallet (rather than your payment method account).. and plus the cancellation of your products at last moment is just too irritating,2,0
Have not expected such a worst experience with big basket. Earlier used to order and get delivered without any hassle. But surprised to see there is zero delivery during lock down. I've switched to other apps.,2,0

The items booking is quite ambiguous. Even if the item is available while booking but after that there is no guarantee that the item is delivered. Ordered many times and many important items though available at the time of booking become unavailable right before delivery. And if I try to cancel the order because of item unavailability I have to pay the extra price. The app owners should take responsibility when the orders are cancelled because of item unavailability.,2,3
Worst customer service,2,0
"Every single time I order the order gets modified and one or other items are not delivered. And the price of the undelivered items are refunded to wallet not original payment source. I am sure they do this deliberately so customer has to order from BB again to utilise the wallet amount and when you order again same thing happens, the order will get modified and so the cycle gets repeated. Don't use BB, just go and buy from nearby store. You will get same quality products for same price.",2,0
"Highly dissatisfied with the way they are operating now in Chennai. I have ordered 19 items yesterday, and now they say that they can't deliver 9 items, which include vegetables as well. Why can't they confirm the availability when we place the order? Why will we RELY on BigBasket if you cannot assure the delivery? I understand if 1 or 2 items are missing, but when you say about 50% items can not be delivered, then why not we will go to the local shop?",2,0
More availablity of vegetables. Whenever we add to cart some products shows out of stock. So please do something for that.,2,0

The quality of items supplied by Big Basket has deteriorated. Earlier vegetables and fruits were fresh but now it seems to be stale and low quality.bThe packing of egg box is inferior. In previous order 4 eggs out of 6:were broke. In yesterday's delivery one egg was rtioen in one box and in the other there were only 5 eggs. Mangoes used to be packed in carton boxes but yesterday it was packed in poly bags which were over ripe and rotten and not edible. So one should think before ordering from B,2,0

The service is good but app sucks. Could you please update the app for below - 1. Filter or sort items based on availability. 2. Do not remove items from list if unavailable.

It's possible that notification not needed any longer after some time.,2,4

From last week trying to order vegetables and fruit but always show slot not available.,2,0
I think it's a waste of time to select things on this app when you don't want to deliver instead of showing the available slots. It's been 2nd week since I am trying to place an order but it's not allowing me to pay and showing that the slots are not available whereas the drop down shows available slots. If it's only for bb star priority customers then it should be mentioned in the application before installation.,2,1

Ultimately did not serve the purpose as I am still in urgent need of groceries and no company willing to deliver.,2,0

Earlier rated 5 coz it was one of my fav app but faced a problem which is unsolved yet so 2 star now! I payed my order online and 2 items was undelivered. It has been 4 days and I didn't get the money added to my wallet not got the refund to the bank itself... Service Centre Call was disconnected every time and I kept texting the service help line but they didn't responded. Very much disappointed.,2,6

"I have tried to order so many times but i didnt get a slot for last 20 days.

Please introduce prepayment through Sodexo mealcards in the app. The delivery agents have always created an issue even before the coronavirus crisis that mealcards cannot be accepted on delivery as the swipe machines don't work or they don't carry the machines.

Be assured of.missing items in your order deliveries. They will take order but then at last minute not deliver some of the items citing unavailability. Amazing how a tech driven platform can manage their inventory so poorly. Also quality of vegetables is mix with some fresh and some stale. Some items like ice cream are as old as an year. Overall their reliability and quality has gone down in last 6 months.,2,1

Took order of 10 items but delivered only 4. Although money was credited but should have been informed while giving order about unavailability,2,0
Your slot system is unpredictable. Difficult to order and most of them are out of stock. Wasting time and 1 or 2 product get cancelled form order and money will be credited to wallet for re-order. Good that you are playing game. Making people buy again and again. What's the use of ordering before when the price is changed on delivery date.,2,2
If order is cancelled there is penalty on customers but no compensation if Big basket fails to deliver full order after accepting order & payment.,2,0
I order groceries and half the items don't get delivered. This is really irritating. How is it possible that while ordering an item it shows that it is available and on the day of delivery it shows that the product is unavailable? Not happy with your service.

"Basic vegetables like cauliflower (whole) and other things are never available. Secondly, if a particular vegetable is not available, then please put a 'out of stock' label at the time of surfing itself.

I am not at all happy with this app. As I am seeing that slots are available for such and such dates and when I select my products to order and go for checkout then suddenly the message appears that all slots are full try again later.

"If a product was out of stock after order is placed, amount should be refunded to the account and not in the wallet. Or that product should be delivered without delivery charge when it is available.

Guys Fix this We already have covid going on So we have no option to go outside Thats why you guys are only hope for us. Hope you will fix it soon and I supoose it aint a Azenda to buy BB premium membership to get slot.,3,3
The fact that the logotype needs to be put in the Icon for familiarity proves that the logo needs a rework.

Please bring all such material too in your store. It will be a great help.",3,0
Slots available but can't place order. Unable to understand why is this happening even after being a bbstar member!! What is the point in becoming a member when you can't get benefits of it? Clearly slots are available but at the time of placing order black pop up message box says no slots available! Contradictory application,3,18
Very good app for shopping grocery during this lockdown in covid but the big basket should improve the slots timing given to customers they sometimes give 2 to 3 days after booking or sometimes the slots are not available. Please improve these. Rest is fine.,3,2
Availability of stock is good but that is of no use because you cannot order due to unavailability of slots even after paying for BBstar membership. Their app and website shows no slots available all the time. I have no idea when the slots are available. At least they could give us notification when slots are available.,3,1
The app is good .They should improve on one thing that is intimating the customer while ordering itself if the product is a available or not. Than sending a message before the order is being delivered. Because all of the products are essential..and we can find another vendor if it is not available with BB.,3,0

"Edit: This token system is far better. now atleast we are getting slots. But there should be an option to contact the delivery person when it says out for delivery.

I have been using bb for several years with ease and all products easily available though many were at MRP . But now due to lockdown I find it difficult to get a slot.

Overall ok. Here are a few issues with the app: 1. Slot availability is a mess.. It keeps showing slots are available and then we don't get slots when you finally add everything in the cart and go to pay. 2. The products that are not there are removed from the list of items and the prepaid money is put in BB Wallet. Why? Why are you not transferring the money to original mode of payment? 3.

"At first it shows the slots are available but at the checkout after selecting all the items and details, I get a message saying no slots are available... I understand this is probably because of the covid 19 rush but please mention properly on the availability of service at the beginning. Tried ordering multiple times each day for the last 2 weeks and each time after reaching the checkout page I'm denied the service.",3,6
I have always loved the service of bigbasket. But it has come of no help during difficult times like the lockdown. Have stopped checking the app now. Elderly people who are alone at home needed services like yours at this moment. It is more than 2 weeks into the lockdown and the fact that you are still not operational in any of the cities is very disappointing.,3,2
"Giving 3 stars cause of 2 issues. 1. add an option in filters to exclude out of stock product. It takes hours to see through inventory having sold out or out of stock. Just put a freaking filter for it, we can select stuff quickly. You competitor have that option(NatureB) 2. Give us access to add order money into bb wallet. As when paying via mobiwik app sometime order payment fail in BB app but app says money deducted. I am happy with product quality which I get. But small app tune up needed.",3,3
"The app is behaving so weird. Items out of stock are showing up . I'm able to add them in basket. On checkout it says items not available. When I click notify it says item available now, but it really isn't because I'm not able to checkout. A few minutes I can understand, but hours after getting notified that item is out of stock it still shows up as available on search pages. How do I even shop?! It's a waste of time adding products to basket.",3,1

I even updated the app but to no use.",3,47
Wide range of grocery items and vegies but the quality of vegetables and fruits are not up to the mark.Atleast 2 or 3 vegies or fruits are spoiled in every order.can return but it is not the point.Did complain but no improvement in picking of vegetables by the packing persons,3,0
"They have come a long way. They are delivering quality products most of the time. I felt let down only with fresh fruits and vegetables. It is a nightmare to get bank offers on this app. What they do is place the order on cod , before going to bank payment page. This is very inconvenient ,if the payment fails. Especially while availing bank offers.",3,53
"Earlier I had given 5 stars to bigbasket. Now I just removed two of them after waiting for more than 6 months to get good service like I used to get when I installed this app two years ago. Vegetables used to be really fresh and clean. Nowadays ( not talking about this lockdown) everytime I get yellow rotten spinach stinking like hell, worst quality of garlic after paying double the amount compared to the nearby shops. It's my request to bb please improve your products quality and also delivery",3,0

"There needs to be an option to add more items to the cart that is paid for and still not out for delivery seriously the one might need to add items later, and as for the option to order again and select the same time slot that is not working too as it's showing can place only one oder at a time.

"Really make a mess when it comes to payments . Their payment portal doesn't always work and sometimes when the payment doesnt go through then you will basically have to wait for trying the second time to make the payment.

I'm using this app last 3 year. All were good in starting but now days it's headache. Quality issue with every 2nd product. Vegetables and fruits quality is so bad we can't consume them.

As expected as 'caring shopper' I checked with neighbors and filled cart with what we need combined than jus by myself reaching a way higher cart value than I would need generally..but the slots are showing full now which were available when I started carting.. I shud have just rather shopped for myself and got what I needed.. Defeats the purpose. I have already emailed on the said address with my phone number.. hope to hear from u asap.,3,0
Booking slots always full. There should be a system for users to be notified when slot is free. We are not jobless to keep looking at your app always and waiting for you to release the slots. Where can I find the BB Star membership benefit of priority in availing slots???,3,0
"The store has almost all grocery, but little pricey on some products. But the thing I hate about is the cancellation of some items in orders and the refund not being initiated to original payment method, instead falls into there app wallet.

Suddenly what is wrong with the app ? I am not able to add items to my basket and even if it's adding when I am checking out the basket is showing empty. Tried reinstalling the app but still the same issue is happening. Kindly check into this on an urgent basis.,3,1
"Very first order, I am dissatisfied. Every Tuesday there is ICICI offer for this month. Ordered as per required guidelines, only to find payment failing forcing me to use alternate card. In addition online payment is preferred since there is liquid cash crunch. But you are suggesting to go for COD. I personally feel that this isn't the right customer centric approach. I lost the voucher application and had to pay the full sum too. Will there be any solution? No reply from app team either.",3,0
Its agood one. Being a star member i expect min good qlty of veggies.prior to lockdown i used to get very fresh and good qlty items.but during this lockdown all items which im getting are poorest qlty.looks like items specially sorted which are already rotten and selling them only.

But better than JioMart who take money but do not deliver!!!",3,1
Since the past 5 days m trying to find a slot but unfortunately even after having a Big Basket star membership m unable to get a slot. What's the use of subscribing to star membership when I can't even get a slot. Totally disappointed!!! Personally prior I have ordered from BigB and the products are really good.

"Hi Team, Thanks for your hardwork in making the things easier by your services in this crucial period. I am still not getting any notifications from your app regarding the slot availability. Last three orders was a mere luck where I found the slots at the right time. Since 2 weeks until now, I am struggling to get the slot available for my order. I have dropped you mail but it seems like all in vain. Please favour me by allowing the notifications via email or phone at best possible manner.",3,0
You guys do not have slots available in my area since over a month now. Almost everyday I check and the slots are full. There has been a complete lockdown in my area since the past 4 days now and it's a huge problem for us to go and get food from somewhere else as travelling is also prohibited. Please do something about this.,3,0

Been a big basketeer for many years now. But it's on a downhill in terms of performance. Getting suitable delivery slot is tough (even in pre lockdown period). Delivery boys goof up and deliver part order only. Many tines app shows items available which are practically out of stock. Quality of fruits and vegetables is deteriorating.,3,2
"The latest software update dated 29 May , 2020 is leading to hanging of my android phone forcing me to force restart option every time I try to use the big basket software .

"Very upset with the service, last one and half week I'm trying to place order, continuously I'm getting msg ""Unfortunately slots are not available"" but in slots it's showing available.

"BB, you are doing a great job. However there is no option for online payment via Sodexo cards. I understand that you don't allow meal passes as a safety concern but Sodexo cards can also be used to pay online like Zomato and others have it . Please add this feature for a better experience.",3,0
Earlier I was very satisfied with the service provided by bisbasket. However I am trying to order few essential items since almost 45days (before starting of lock down period) but not getting the slot . I am very much disappointed for not getting a slot for so long,3,0
"When we apply the Vouchers The transactions get failed and is converted into cod for some error issue. Therefore, we don't get any discount on vouchers.",3,0
"My last experience of buying vegetables from BB was way too horrible. Amongst the items were few rotten tomatoes and cucumbers. Therefore, I stopped buying live food items and instead keep on buying the other packed stuff.",3,0
"During this lockdown crises, It always shows that all slots are full 24×7. This is very much disappointed. I am trying to place the order from past 20 days. That's why the rating of this app is decreasing day by day. On the Home page, it is always written that Bigbasket deliveres over 30,000 people daily. Please stop giving this fake information. I hope that you will do the needful for those who are in need.",3,1
Everything is fine with the service apart from delivering the service on time. There is always a delay in delivering the order. If i am selecting a slot between 7a.m- 9a.m however they will deliver the order aftr 10 am or 10:45am.,3,0
"Atleast you are delivering during lockdown, but the app I felt its very clumsy. One thing which pisses me off the most is, I keep adding stuff in the cart and while checking out the review tells many products unavailable..so back to square one. Stuffs are costly here comparitive to others.",3,0
"All good except for the fact that it has a few products listed for which the add to cart button doesn't work and certain things are shown unavailable only right before the payment page, even though the products are still hown as available in the catalogues.",3,0
App is good but If you add Google Pay also it will be very usefull. Because for paytm we need to add amount but for Google Pay it will be debited from our Bank account. Few seasonal fruits now cost has been redused but still you rates are redused.,3,0
I thought once you have a funds in wallet and pay the membership fees it easy to get slot.But I'm really disappointed. Every minute I check to get slot. But it's always the same no slot available.,3,0
Updating as service other than below is good. Huge decline in customer service. Be careful with new orders. Trying to scam with cancelation charges and the customer care number is not dialable from Airtel. Chat customer care only does copy paste without even reading queries.,3,1
"The app shows delivery slot available. But on checkout, it display message that no delivery slots are available at the moment. This has been happening all the time since last 2 days.",3,2
Over all its fine but few glitches like some of the items gets cancelled on the day its supposed to be delivered and they don't notify you. The money is credited to bb wallet so we are bound to buy from them. Can not rely on bb for essentials.,3,0
"The notify function is not working. If I press notify for a product and later close the app, the next time I open it I see the same product as un notified and I have to click notify again. Due to this I am not able to receive notification when the product is back in stock. Do fix this bug. Thanks!",3,0
Good app but lacks a basic feature of filtering the out of stock products. Its annoying to see such a basic feature is not there. Have to scroll through all the out of stock products and wasting time.,3,0
The slots for booking is a mess and whenever they show that slot is available in checkout it will show slot is unavailable. If this problem continues then it is difficult to buy the essential items.,3,0

After entering notify, I receive the sms that the product is now available but again the same story, unavailable in checkout. The slots are shown but then is unavailable during checkout.",3,0
"It a wonderful experience shopping here. Only concern is that if we couldn't pay online.. The order should not be processed. Sometimes we order to different location where elderly people are there , so payment may not be possible on delivery. You accept orders first even if payment fails online. Pls change that mode.",3,0
Best service but some vegetables are littlebit damages..,3,0
Trying since last 8 days not getting a slot. Earlier even when lockdown started and in between slots were available in at least 3/4 days. Now instead of situation improving BB is getting worse even with star members like me.,3,1
Good overall if you are okay with throwing tomatoes and potatoes as soon as they are delivered as vegetables are rotton generally. Overall okay if no better option nearby.,3,0

"On home screen slot is available however at the time of payment it is showing slot is not available, I am trying since last 3 days...please resolve",3,0
Nice app to buy packaged items but keep an eye on expiry dates as they try to flush expired goods out and cheat customers who may not notice. Don't recommend this for fruits and veggies as their quality has down a lot.,3,0

"Overall experience is excellent in terms of quality, packing, delivery before today's experience. Which must be improved: 1) I have ordered 25 items out of which 2 were cancelled due to unavailability, rest 23 items also were not delivered by BB. I asked on chat I was told that my address is unserviceable. I was surprised to hear the reason as I have received many orders on the same address. 2. The chat reps ends chats without any intimation for ending chat.",3,0

Great options to select They should include more brands and break down to smaller quantity if possible.

Keep up and looking forward for even better service enhancement from Big Basket,3,0

"With COVID19 affecting your delivery, here are some free tips from a UX expert: 1) Please add a filter on your products listing page ""filter by availability"". 2) Some products show a delivery slot and some don't. If you add products that don't show a fixed delivery slot, your system seems to revert the whole order as undeliverable. Grey out products that can't be delivered. For the customer, ""undeliverable"" is ""unavailable"". They create failed orders. 3) provide map tracking like Zomato",3,0

"Overall experience is good, thanks for taking up the task during this difficult period, I want to point out one thing which I didn't like, when my order is undelivered due to lack of inventory or other reasons the refund amount is deposited in the big basket wallet regardless of the payment option I have chosen during the payment, please try to change this, we might use the money later but we can use it for other things if the money is credited to our bank(our primary payment method).",3,1

I usually don't comment or write anything about any app unless it pleases me to an extent that makes me feel like appreciating or get into my nerves.I have been using this app for more than one yr and it's services aren't improving but getting down. In the beginning it always delivers to the slot selected but gradually slots and goods availability start decreasing.But now Zomato and swiggy started doing the same job their services r fast and appreciable.look into urself big basket an do smthng,3,0
"Wonderful shopping experience for all your grocery needs but many more payment options should be introduced like Amazon wallet icici pockets bank wallet and many more payment methods, refund takes 7 to 9 days, refund should be processed fast instant atleast with 24 hours for all the cancelled orders",3,0
"Have been using for years, inventory is good better compared to other sellers. But after lockdown, I was forced to check for other options because bigbasket doesnt support sodexo online payment. Many people like me has amount piled up in sodexo after offices being closed. Switched to jiomart and grofers as they accept sodexo, and using BB only for items not available there now.",3,0

Has lot of variety and has ample delivery slots. Only issue I see is high prices,3,0
It has to improve a lot more,3,0
Range of products is good... But prices are high,3,0
Big basket is very expensive. If you buy grocery worth 2000 you end up paying more than 200 compared to Grofers or Flipkart or Amazon. All badic grocery items are comparitively expensive,3,0
"Some of the items are not good ,like banana,palak , sweet corn etc",3,0
A good app but customer service isnt good. One executive kept my call on hold for 7-8 minutes and didn't answer back. The app is a bit slow and hangs sometimes.,3,0
The quality of vegetables is the worst inspite of continuous complaints. Please switch to other app if you need to buy fresh vegetables and fruits.,3,0
"While it has always been a smooth sailing process earlier, since I have relocated to Hyderabad BB is causing trouble. My online payment with debit card was debited thrice n the card got blocked. Doesn't happen with other sites, bit with BB earlier. Pls resolve the issue ASAP.",3,0
App is not opening since few days. otherwise groceries are of good quality but really upsets about fruits and vegetables.they are not if good and fresh quality .so for veggies I will not refer to anyone .,3,0
"The worst part of Big Basket is that you will turn old but you won't get any available slots... Have to move back to Groffers again just for this issue of not getting available delivery slots.. Other than this and that the prices are a bit on higher side than in the market, overall app experience is good!",3,0
Fruit and vegetables quality is really bad . Really bad experience Delivery slot problem . Other service is very good.,3,0
Always showing no slots available I have tried numerous times but same thing is happening recently I deleted this app and ordered from Grofers. This is really disappointing...,3,0
Took me longer than usual to place the other. Do understand due to lockdown. Would not mind if the delivery is done area wise so at least a wait time given as compared to no delivery.,3,0
"Until the recent update with slots, I was a frequent buyer at BB. But now, clearly the new subscription plan is ruling over. If you're not ready to pay those extra bucks, there will be no slots! Bear in mind that this is a scenario aside of delivery fees. That's an entirely different story. I cannot begin to understand why I would want to pay for express delivery if I find no slots available for at least 2 days. Bad move, BB. Uninstalled right away.",3,0

"These guys have good service and good quality of items(except 1-2 times got lil rot veggies, but that's ok, it's rainy n that happens). All I dislike about them is their amount on which they take delivery charges. Even purchase of 500 isn't enough for them to wave off delivery. So I limited my purchase and turned to jio & other local market shops n m happy for that",3,0

"When I'm not able to remove any payment method on the app by going into the settings, it's a deal breaker for me - because that's a major security flaw which seems to have not caught the attention of yet another clever e-commerce company's clever developers.

Some what high price and high delivery charges,3,0
Services have gone down a lot since its inception. earliar undelivered item was rare. also service time was good. moreover the membership plan is like u cant get your items in 1 day without membership. product range is still good. availibility has become an issue. using this app since the days it started but customer satisfaction is going down day by day. if 5 products are not delivered in the end. i have to go to a superamrket. that means i could have gone directly without wasting time inapp,3,0
Can't blame BB but disappointed that they removed Express delivery and bbstar delivery slots but panic buying causing all the troubles most of times are out of stock hoping situation get better.,3,1
"The app has been great in the past but of late I am facing multiple issues. For one, delivery slots suddenly become full and a customer who spent 30 mins shopping on site, comes to know only at checkout that there is no delivery available. On their home screen too there is a mention of next available slot but even that option doesn't appear on check out. This has happened to me a few times and it is very frustrating.",3,0

App has lots of bugs,3,0
"Great deals & product variety. But shopping experience is far from smooth. Always picks up a default Bangalore address from nowhere (not in my saved addresses) in spite of manually setting correct address before shopping. Checkout shows the Bangalore address which then needs to be changed to the correct address, and then the cart gets updated by removing items which were available for the Bangalore address only. Have to again fill up half the cart. Frustrating as this happens each time.",3,97
"Bad starting experience. The app waits till customers check out to tell them that there are no slots available for delivery. Why make them go through the trouble of finding items amd adding to cart? Waste of time! Dear developers, plz read my comment above more carefully. Plz inform your customers that slots are full before they start adding items, and not at check out.",3,0
No coupon or voucher,3,0
"Good app, navigation is great however issue is it should accept automatically the best best offer like in case of phone pay which applies the best offer in the house and it even changes basis the card.

Don't know how but app has improved and so ( presumably) , service quality...will update in another week,🙂",3,9
App wise very good no bugs. Never seen any issues with app. Over priced mostly and also when ordered vegetables are not that fresh. They don't give time to review your items on delivery to check the quality(mainly vegetables and expiry dates on snacks) and make sure items as per the order,3,0

"For me experience was ok ok. Reason why i am writting this is lot of features i dont like good. Being number 1 site in the online grocery you have to be excellent in all parameters. First of all when user going to place order online, it by default takes COD payment, even if user forgot to apply discount voucher. Now in cancel order option, one listed reason is 'Forgot To apply voucher' , but there also if u try to apply, then it shows , order is pending so cannot apply. Deadlock.",3,38
"For the last four weeks i cant get a slot for delivery! Doesnt work for me if i cant get stuff when i need it, and one can't call anyone for support as far as I could see, don't have time or patience for an ongoing dialogue to sort out the issue, so i deleted the app.",3,0
"While the deals and the delivery are efficient, I'm totally dissatisfied with the Card-on-Delivery payment option. Every time this option is selected, all the delivery executives have the same excuse that card machine is not functional, and ask us to pay by cash instead. Please implement this option in an efficient manner, or remove it altogether if you cannot deliver on it, instead of creating unwanted confusion.",3,8
They really need to work on performance of the application or server. Facing huge lags when trying to browse products. Takes tens of seconds to load a page. And I am sure it's not an internet or device problem.,3,4
Many of the items which are out of stock are not shown at time of search but it is shown at time of checkout causing inconvenience so please look into it either all things are fine and upto the mark,3,0

"Common brands product are missing and if there most of the time out of stock. Filter option shd be more simplified, not every time PPL go for new items. Placing order shd be not more than 15 min, if it takes more PPL will walk away to store. Same brand products if provided in drop down will help customers. Options shd be there for organic and sugar free product browsing. Right now search show everything inspite of specif words in search.",3,0
I used to really love big basket till they changed the express delivery slots. Before I place my order the express delivery slots show one time and at the time of checkout it shows a different time. It used to be very seamless but now looks like the standard delivery slots are faster than the express ones since they want us to take their special membership.,3,6

Sir/Madam - I had experienced with your Online booking that if you order 10 items and pay full amount and at the time of delivery you come with an excuse that 2 or 3 items not available and my money is help up with you and again if you order same thing persist. Very sorry I am not happy with your online service. Please arrange to return back the balance amount standing in my account with out any further delay. Every order this is happening. It seems there is no coordination in your Office.,3,0
"Please display proper messages to the end users. For example, if a credit card with voucher associated with it is used more than allowed numbers during offer period, the app shows message that states wrong payment method selected. This kind of message is misnomer and difficult to understand the actual error.",3,3
"I like overall experience, timely delivery, custom message, good support & specially offers make this whole different ans better ! Keep up good work 👍 (hold on ...on a ticket number...same thing - discount looks as applied then after payment page, original amount is deducted... now with customer care as usual...who will either suggest to cancel order to apply voucher else no solution...kindaa repetitive 🤐",3,1
"The service is pretty good, haven't faced any delays yet. The only problem is that you have to check the exp on perishable items. It has happened to me a few times now, that whenever I have ordered bread the expiry date on it would be usually the day after it was delivered if not the same day. I like bread but not enough to finish the entire loaf in one day. The same goes for cup cakes or milk products.",3,6
"Wonderful app experience! However, the fact that returns booked are never addressed after the delivery is made and also products are either not available ever or go out of stock and dont show up for long, seem certainly as operational lags that havent been sorted. You are too big a brand to goof up now.",3,0
"Really disappointed from last two experiences. I ordered a specific product which was available in the products catalogue both the time. Each time I didn't get it, reason being it's unavailability. Items which are not available should be shown as out of stock on application or else if they have been added successfully to the cart should be delivered as is.",3,177
"Well the app is pretty good designed, only thing that I didnt like about it that if you pay for the delivery you will receive the item within time, however if you dont pay for the delivery you will receive the notification about your order is being out but there could be sometime when your order will not be delivered at the same day.",3,10
Finally the option of Jhatka is available. I'll wait and see until this becomes regular... I'll change it to 5 stars immediately. Thank you Bigbasket,3,0
"Card on delivery option is not of use. they NEVER have swipe machines. also they do different tricks for paying in cash by customer; like today - he called me for telling as ""bymistaken he have updated as delivered with cash payment, but going to deliver in next half hour, so keep ready cash"". I suggest there should be UNDO option for delivery updated by delevry boy.",3,0
"I had a very grate experience with this app. I think there should be more fresh vegetables, because some of the vegetables were rot when I received it. Else, everything is fine.",3,0
"Big basket app is good, only issue is first places the order then checks for payment. Payment window is slow, most of the time fails, when retry offer code is not applied. So missing offers. For do payment then place order. If anyone want cash on delivery add one option for that.",3,17

"Most annoying pet peeves with BB is it doesn't have any account logged in check feature.

Not at all good. The App should accept the payment (except COD) and then place the order. Because of network issues if payment does not happen the whole order had to be cancelled. Once I was illegally chanrged cancellation charge for no fault of mine. Even after complaint the money was not refunded.,3,2

Not suitable for a small family whose requirements are very less. Though its a very authentic app for grocery shopping as the range is vast but the delivery charges are the worst part. They don't even provide any packaging neither cloth bag or poly bag still they charge you huge delivery fee. So i will recommend spencer over bigbasket in kolkata.,3,0

"They claim to service multiple addresses in multiple cities . Obviously, that would mean Different Phone numbers for different addresses. They even have provision for a phone number in DELIVERY ADDRESS. But that is just for Show. The delivery person calls on Registered number only. When I contacted Customer care, even they said that no ""Alternate Number"" is provided in my Profile . So everytime i want to get an order delivered at a different address, i need to change the number in profile.",3,0
Don't order vegetables. they shows the fresh vegitable images in this app. But they send home the spoils. i experianced this situation.,3,0
Good app with discounts. However they do not refund the money in case some item is not available. This is very wrong practice. Against the consumer rights. Big Basket must refund money immediately to the account from which payment is made in case something is not available.,3,1
"There is no option to talk to customer service, u have preset questions, but if your query is out of those questions then no help from team..also preset questions comes with preset answers if u are not satisfied with them, then its users problem not the big basket's.",3,2
"Most of the vegetable are expensive then market rate. Apples are most of the time of bad quality. Some times vegetables come in so bad, how can a person who is packing cant see that?

"I had installed application two days ago and placed first order for the amount of Rs 4500 approx. The order was delivered yesterday. To my surprise the delivery boy named Rishi delivered packets scattered numbering around 35 approx over floor outside the door and left. Neither he asked me for empty bags nor Bigbasket had any arrangements to supply the ordered groceries, fruits and vegetables in well packed conditions in the cloth bags or plastic bags. Lodged complaint with Customer Care.",3,0
"I feel the performance is degrading now a days. While ordering, it will show items and just before delivering, the item will not be available... This lead often disappountment. If item not available, show it as ""out of stock"". or so..",3,0
Useless app..pathetic customer service,3,0
"Please include a ""save for later"" feature too so that, we can save a list of items we have to order on a later date meanwhile ordering the things immediately needed.",3,2
Was really impressed with bigbasket quality and delivery but now we are not able to order as it always shows that slots are full in indore. Please try to fix it as soon as possible. it's an humble request to you.,3,0
The offers are not so attractive anymore. In a particular slot the delivery always reaches at the very end of that slot despite being a BB Star member. Still I continue to use it.,3,3
"Not many offers. BBstar membership is utter useless. Very profit oriented. Also they have been continuously increasing their plastic covers for fruits and vegetables, which is not good on the environment front. Much better to go the the local grocery store with your own bag.",3,9
"Nice. But i was not fully satisfied, due in vegetable section, it was hopeless. Not implemented till now, since i was using more than 2yrs.",3,3
Good app but the notifications are beginning to bother me a lot. No way to stop the ads.,3,0
Decent app for day to day purchases. Sometimes they do not deliver products on time. Often products have some damage especially eggs. Rest is all okay.,3,2
"Big Basket is there in the market since long time but still doesn't provide UPI payment option. Not good!! Also, no Sodexo payment option to pay directly from the app. We need to ask delivery person to send the link and then will have to make the payment. Why can't I get this option when I place the order from the app. Please work on that.",3,4
"It has got a disadvantage for ordering with credit/debit card..If there is a failure in online transaction,they take the order automatically in cash on delivery mode..Thus it will not let u use any promocode for debit/credit card..And if you cancel the order, they often add charge in the next order..Advantage is On time delivery..",3,2
Filters not working properly... please throw particular codes for the filter options... low to high and high to low.... thats from technical purpose Apart from that basic and much needed app for every households,3,0
Big basket refunded the money for the returned item after a 3 weeks time. This is the slowest refund ever seen. Delivery is good. I have no other option other than big basket to use so this the best app for me.,3,0
Don't cancel item after placing order,3,0
amazing app. you can get stuff that's not available in your city! but quality of food items delivered is sometimes sub standard...gave a review about that on app after my last order. but no response came. that's a definite drawback.,3,0

"Bb is better than the other online shopping apps. I'll Appreciate their timely delivery and their customer services. But one thing I am disappointed on is that after prepaid payments sometimes they remove some items stating stock out, now if they knew there wasn't appropriate stock, that should be informed before checking out for payment because at times there is urgency for some product. Over all i'll give it a 👍",3,1
"Initially it was good, but recently had a bad experience regarding cash back. They expect us to read the terms and conditions before applying an Offer code, rather than having a validation check from their end. Strange ! Customer service is not good. Also every time food quality is not good.",3,0
"Good and user-friendly app. Selecting, ordering, payment and checkout are smooth & easy. However, my first experience with a coconut from BB was very bitter. On breaking it the very next day after delivery, it was found fully rotten. I had to throw it away, and I lost my Rs.35/- for its price. Similar was mutton curry cut which had more bones than meat. Requesting BB to rectify these issues in future. 5 stars only after that. Otherwise, packaging and timely delivery are excellent.",3,0
"Good for online shopping. But lacking in some aspects. Sometimes they fail to deliver some products and use to credit the balance in big basket wallet for purchase next time. big basket wallet is not versatile, it only used for shopping from big basket. As bb star customer I didnt get any kind of privilege. After being a bb star customer I am facing problems for getting delivery slots. it's better to become a normal customer and have as much as possible slots , paying for delivery.",3,1
"Compared to Big Basket beginning, now they offer more value to customers by way of better options at time of checkout. However, their offer is more in terms of banks and wallet apps than by their own. On this, Grofers scores well. Its individual offers are unmatchable. Worse, BB has recently taken out its own offer of five percent discount at checkout.",3,1
Have been a regular customer but latest update is sending too much of notifications which I don't want in office environment. Either Give me options to choose which kind of notification I want else I uninstall this app.,3,1

"In this basket really all verities are there and available in this time, but when i am trying to ordering but it's showing checkout ...... Then how i can buy.",3,0
It's satisfying. Hope they provide fresh vegetables. This app is value for money. But they should not compromise the quality of the products.,3,0
"Decent app, great customer support until the most recent one (had to face a very rude guy when I raised why am I charged delivery charges for orders above 600 despite being a bb* customer). Apart from this one incident the rest of the customer support conversion has been really pleasant. Prices aren't always the best, as I get better prices in regular kirana shop more often than not. Vegetables aren't the best in class (considering slightly higher price and less lifetime from street markets).",3,0
You are frequently updating the app. It should be user friendly. But every time it is more complicated than earlier,3,2
Why there is no Sodexo Prepaid Payment available like Grofers.,3,0
I never understand .. If your free iteam not available than why you are showing . free iteam added in our basket .. but at the time of final processing.. you always mentioned free iteam not available .. like from last one moth you are showing Zandu iteam as free but you never given .. by question is if this iteam not available as free than why you are showing as free Better you delete the same .. 99.9% time I noticed you Never given free iteam to any one .. this is very Funny from your side,3,0

"Good app for shopping grocery on the go. Smart basket and recommendations are really helpful. But I am disappointed by the drop of the quality of fruits and vegetables. I received rotten cherries and they got replaced with rotten cherries. Organic carrots and celery often come rotten. Once I received disgusting rotten chicken in the name of country chicken. So annoyed at the drop of quality of products delivered by BB. Have been a regular customer for years, but now losing trust.",3,0

"it is wonderful app however it would be helpful for the customer if live tracking of delivery person added to it like food online app contains, becuse i ordered four or five times and it said that the order was out for delivery but i dont know when i would get it exactly and where the order was, because i was in rush of going out but delayed due to this",3,0
"i want something like when you order items from the basket and later on the person wants to cancel some items which it doesnt need , it would be easy not to cancel the whole item instead you can select the items you dont want and cancel it .",3,1

"I like ordering stuff in bulk on monthly basis as it falls easier to sort out, however the products get segregated into different delivery slots depending on the products choosen and so get delivered separately which leaves me payin delivery charges of various items separately though they were ordered all at once ......

Bigbasket is a good start but needs improvement. Good things: 1. Doorstep delivery 2. Good handling of items 3. Trained delivery persons Things to improve: 1.

False discounts: The prices of veggies and fruits are first inflated and then they show you a discounted price which is the same that you get in local markets.,3,0

"With COVID19 affecting your delivery, here are some free tips from a UX expert: 1) Please add a filter on your products listing page ""filter by availability"". 2) Some products show a delivery slot and some don't. If you add products that don't show a fixed delivery slot, your system seems to revert the whole order as undeliverable. Grey out products that can't be delivered. For the customer, ""undeliverable"" is ""unavailable"". They create failed orders. 3) provide map tracking like Zomato",3,0

"Delivery was good, I am pleased that they deduct the cost of missing items in bill itself, also their packaging is good. Satisfied with overall service. But I am disappointed with stale vegetables being delivered sometimes, and some of them even began to decay the very next day(PS had to discard a good amount of vegetables a number of times). But this app is better than most of the other delivery apps and would still recommend this to others. Referral codes feature could also be added.",4,173

"Since my last review( in which I complained of lack of slot availability and provided 2 stars ), I was able to avail slots after a few days and could order the essentials.

It would be better if those items are available like they were earlier.",4,10
"I love this app..most of my household items vome from this App delivery us good.. products are also good.Before this pandemic they used to give huge discounts..But during the pandemic even big basket raised the prices of the goods.. trying to sell products on MRP..I would suggest to add all Patanjali goods and even some local brands of particular area, where we can get some desi local stuff should b added..Overall Would recommend this app.",4,4
Awesome... I would have given complete 5 stars... But the only issue is that the default address is unable to get changed. The app should be more tech friendly... Else it's a very helpful app... One need not go to departmental store anymore...,4,15
Overall I like big basket but one problem that i have with it is that it only tells us at the time of checkout if any of the products in our cart is unavailable due to any reason. Edit: It's absolutely inefficient. Frozen products are available for sale but are not delivered in proper condition. I orderer ice cream and it was completed melted. Worst experience.,4,1
Big basket is not what it use to be. Product list has gone down . Many a times out of stock or not for sale . You have started the token option. I suppose I didn't have problem with slot this time. BB star had more voucher options initially . Even that's not there . Great if you can have tie up with more vegan companies. Specially vegan ghee,4,5
Easy to use. Wish information regarding items that don't get delivered would be communicated earlier than at the time of the physical delivery.,4,2
Veggies and fruits are not so fresh. Apart from veggies it is a good app for other goods. Hope they improve in the quality of veggies and fruits.,4,1
Easy navigation and user friendly experience. Clear picture quality.,4,0
Good app compared with any other online grocerystores. But my suggestion is that to make it free delivery so that many people use this app as some are leaving this because of high delivery charges for limited amount . If there are no delivery charges this app is awesome with some positives like :- # fast delivery i.e within 1 or 2 days. # delivery slot bookings according to our convenience . # good offers on bb products. ***Only negative other than some products high cost is delivery charges .,4,49
"It's a wonderful app but l have gave 4 stars because the slot is full everytime , means we have to check everytime and then sometimes the slot is empty and then we can place the order , otherwise it is a great app for online grocery shopping specially at this time........",4,2

Please provide COD .1star will be pending for COD. Whn COD available 1 star thn",4,1
Suggestion: improve the app by adding the ability to easily add previously brought Items in basket. now I have to search the items again. but if I have the list of previously brought items I can quickly select them for my next purchase. or add a favorite list option .,4,5
Overall experience is good but it should have an option to include items in the list if forgot to after confirmation.,4,3
"Although it's really an amazing and helpful app...I really like this app.. and use it regularly.. they are really working hard.. thank you so much.. but there is 1 problem.. when bb started issuing token...

"Shopping through app smooth. Price is also good, but there are catches among campaigns. Few gets very lucky based on requirements. Kindly design some vouchers for smaller buyers for say minimum Rs.500/- and on UPI based transactions... Overall good.",4,0
"Pros : user friendly, delivery in time, quality of the products. Cons: All the products are not available, can't change the mobile number. I like this app and I use this very frequently. So far no complaints.",4,3
It does have all the required products and there is a delivery charge being applied. The product category is not appropriate for any new user. The app needs lot of customization. And there should be a list feature to be added.,4,1

I don't know what is wrong with the app.. It is keep on loading the home page from past 3-4 days... Seems to be something related with the Prod Server or the database... Kindly look into the issue.. Please consider this review as a prod defect. It takes me 5-6 min to See the ap functioning well.. Earlier it was not an issue. Thanks!,4,26
The product received from BB is always good. Meets qlty standard. Thank you BB team..,4,0
"I know with the pandemic the slots availability has been an issue. But that is the only drawback which seems to be inevitable. I usually find 95-98% of my groceries list here, and with the current situation you have been a ton of help, thank you big basket.",4,1
This app is very nice but one things is very disturbing that in the lockdown period always slots are full .sometime in my phone massages are coming that slots are clear but when l open the app shows that slots are full. This is the cause l given four stars. Please fix this problem.,4,1
"No hesitation is rating you guys. extremely good job during the lockdown. However, you really need to add alot more bank offers. Look for the best cards being used 😉",4,0
It was good but cash on delivery and exchange options should be available,4,0
"The best part is that the delivery boys open all items and check in front of us, so we can return what is not fresh or stale.",4,1
Nice experience. Only one issue is while checking out basket we will not be sure of availability of the items. While putting in the basket itself stock should be updated.,4,0
"It is good on the whole. But when I search for a product under a group, eg.Jersey ghee 200gm pack, I don't find it easily. 500gms is found, and then after scrolling through a long list which is a mixture of ghee and different oils, I find a 1kg pack. Again search through the remaining and I found it at the end. If it is not there the whole search is a waste. Ghee and oils can be separated, one brand all sizes in one place. Not in stock items are too many, but we have to go through. Even shampoo.",4,1
"Good interface, good and quick service.4 star. Missed one star due to not having option to add alternate contact number; sometimes quality of veg not good. Otherwise, rocks.",4,0
"It's a good app and very fast delivery indeed. Order placed in the morning will be delivered next morning and that's a good thing. However, due to a lot of usage many of the items are unavailable. That's a bummer.",4,0
App works fine. Service and products available are good. Only complaint is that the product portfolio is not vast enough.,4,1
It's nice. It will be great if you can include selection of vegetables in multiple weight options. Mostly smallest available for vegetables is 500 gm which is too much for a small family,4,1
"Order process till payment is very smooth. Taking down one star due to lack of sodexo card payment. I am aware that physical coupons can't be used, but many of us have virtual cards, which used to work earlier.",4,0
Great app.. Ordered in morning and got it delivered at night by 8pm. Even shows track of ur order. Prices for some products are little high. Looking forward for more orders if BB products will be in good quality..,4,0
Good experience for the first time. But delivery charges could have been vaid. It could have been better if delivery is with out any charges.,4,0
Good experience for these App and I was charmed with it's quick service. Thanks a lot. But recently it's very Slow service disheartening me a lot when I eagerly waiting for their friendly co-operation as required during this epidemic periods.,4,1
"Generally good quality packed products. But, Many common items like sooji are usually out of stock, though they are available at the grocery store. Also vegetables quality is also in need of major improvement.",4,0
"Good app. But unavailability of products should be visible before we put in the basket, not while checking out",4,0
The app and services are great. The only thing keeping me from giving 5 star is you aren't accepting my hdfc food plus card. Please accept food card. It's same as debit or credit card. Please..,4,0
Few items are not available every time I shop..I don't know why??? After purchasing all these items one of them will be missing again we have to visit outside stores...,4,1
"Availability of Fresh vegetables & fruits is a plus point. Also wide range of food items from various categories are available, which makes buying very convenient.",4,1
Everything is ok but main problem is to get the booking slot. You have to always carry on trying to get the booking slot.,4,2
"Very helpful app and service for daily groceries, fruits, vegetables and cereals etc. Delivery is quick and slot options are there for ease.",4,0

very easy to use... i dont like one thing that it allow items to select even when it know my default address n then in checkout it notify about unavailability..less one point for same..,4,0

"It's great, but sometimes we have issue at payment gateway..that process of completing order even if payment fails..gets confusing",4,0
"Excellent experience! especially delivery process!! improve to bridge the gap between order, and out of stock during delivery. This refund is credited in big basket account and to the mop used, like other apps.",4,1
"I have a suggestion for the developers team of bigbasket... Once an order is on the way, it will be great if you develop the feature of live gps tracking of the delivery boy so that customer knows exactly where the driver is and when he will be arriving. Otherwise as per bb policy, within 1 or 2 hour slot anytime if the driver comes then he waits maximum 2-5mins and leaves and a customer can be busy in that 2mins in an hour slot. This feature will help the client as well as delivery process.",4,0
Good App (there's some place for improvement and you could add some more grocery stuff) Helps us to order things from home when we are busy and can't go out due to this pandemic... 😁👍👍👍 Good job bigbasket,4,1

Its fast and easy to use. Really like the experience,4,0
The app is great but please incorporate payment through Sodexo Meal Cards. Sodexo Coupons are outdated. Cards are the updated way of payment.,4,0
I really like the service thei provide. I feel app design can surely be improved. One thing I kind of dislike is reaching customer care isn't easily accessible.,4,0
"Quite good exp. However sometimes I get spoiled items like veggies, fruits. You guyz need to work on that.",4,0
Placed the order but let's see how the order is going to be delivered. The app is quick but certain items which are daily essentials shows out of Stock. They should be available.,4,0

Very convenient to shop and the entire process is smooth.,4,0
Overall experience is good. Good quality products. Item prices are in moderate-high range. Good service during pandemic. Suggestion - 1. Kindly include sodexo meal card as a prepaid payment option for food/groceries/applicable items.,4,1
Convenient way of getting groceries on your doorstep provided the delivery slots are available. Would have been helpful if we receive notifications when the delivery slots become available for a particular location.,4,0

"Bigbasket has been a good experience, especially during this lockdown. They have had great service and very kind staff.

"Very easy to select the items with different options. Timely delivery , delivery boys are very cordial, easy to get connected with customer service through chats and problems get resolved in no time. Excellent service and would recommend to everyone to buy from here. Earlier given 5 stars but now edited to give 4, the reason being the vegetables and flowers are NOT fresh. They don't select the good ones and send which becomes rotten in just a day.",4,6

Some products are always out of stock even after notifying about it. However the app and services are good specially at Covid time 👍,4,0

Very frustrating. It is showing use location and picking the area but when placing order it is flashing message Unable to take as all slot are full. I have been trying innumerable time to place my order but going in vain. Surely not useful right now when it is urgently needed. Truly very agonizing moment. Hope viable resolution of this glitches.,4,0
Your chat system is not working ?,4,0
Very Good. But 1 thing I wish to mention that as per your website BB is purchasing fruits & vegetables directly from farmers but many times I found that BB prices are equal to vegetables & fruits we are purchasing from local vendors who are purchasing from APMC markets. Also stuffs other than fruits & vegetables are costlier than Dmart.,4,3
Very good service & time management.,4,0
Satisfied quality and delivery of items,4,0
The app is very user friendly. Only issue would be that sometimes things don't get delivered even after the order has been placed (it's not a problem because they instantly credit the wallet with the amount when the order is prepaid). And absolute best compliments to their customer support team. The grievance redressal over email is almost instant.,4,2

Nice app for delivery.. All were fresh and good,4,0
Delivery of items is not as per order placed,4,0
Groceries are fresh. The persons are on time but still the rates should be a little less I feel. With these kinds of apps around shopping experience is gonna change for sure. Also one business error I have seen that any error results in the money being dumped into the wallet. Please avoid this as people are not happy from this.,4,2

"Easy to use. All the features we generally need are available. A couple of areas of improvement. 1. Security: When the mobile number is changed, I think it is advisable to send a message/ OTP to the old number to indicate that mobile number has been changed. Currently no indication is sent. 2. Availability: When an item is not available - at the time of checkout - it should clearly be indicated. Instead App was complaining that slots are not available.",4,99
The only thing that is Frustrating is to keep waiting for the slot. A very time consuming process . Please devise an appropriate method like Amazon. Thank you,4,0
Ease of operation. But range of stock is limited and most of items are out of stock.,4,0

"I'm editing my earlier review since the earlier review grabbed the attention of the developers and the customer team. They were able to satisfactorily provide a resolution to all my standing concerns. Based on the services provided in the app, I'm altering my review which is pretty great! I just have one suggestion though. I do understand that these are unusual times but the customer team can't just defer all resolution for an indefinite period.",4,0
As usual they cancel at last moment and convert money to their credits. It is a scam. I used it after long time but they are still same Edit : issue was resolved. So 4 star now,4,7
Good delivery within the time,4,0
"Good experience, good quality, but prices are high to common people , please make a change....",4,0
Easily the best app for buying groceries or daily household items with wide range of variety. One star less as they didn't have service during lockdown. Otherwise fantastic app with huge savings. 👍,4,0
Product quality & delivery is good. However the app has issues now. The inventory status is inaccurate in the list view (is mostly accurate when you click on a single product) and when you checkout you are told that half of the products are not available. The notification feature resets everytime you place an order (and not when the product is in stock and notified) as a result you have to keep on adding the 'notify me' feature. The smart basket is not smart. Just Show product order frequency,4,4
"In lock down, veggies are fresh.. please continue to deliver fresh products",4,0
"The app and service of BigBasket is great, when you get a slot, that's is. However I do feel they are trying to overcome the issue in that regard. However, the annoying part is when the homepage says slots are available, but when you go to place orders, then a message pops up saying no slots. Also there is no distinction between an available and non-available product without going to the product page. Maybe gray them out?",4,23
"It's a good app, please keep more discounts though",4,0

My overall experience was good but from past few days I wasn't able to place my order though slots were available. I think there is a big bug in this app.. Though the slots are available we can't proceed. On check out page it displays no slot available.. And now after upgrading the app I am able to place the order. It should ask the user to update the app instead showing no slot available.,4,16
"Overall a good experience but i have noticed one problem lately. Whenever i am trying to place order for mask, it is displaying that it has failed to add item to the cart and its not just about one mask but for all the masks.. and that is proving bit annoying.. i appreciate the service that you are rendering yet your kind help in this matter will be greatly appreciated",4,1

"Have been using BBasket but during initial days of lockdown for COVID, the app was unprepared with updates and reasons for inaction by app. Even Big Basket was not giving correct answer. Hopefully Big Basket does not let down this time. When things work ""almost"" like routine during crises, the system is good and almost foolproof. I see Big Basket is trying to get better with days. I also heard the founder's msg and the efforts they were taking to meet the challenge. Hope to see a robust system",4,0
"The best part about this app is that it genuinely shows you if items are out of stock while placing the order as well as at checkout, hence you don't end up paying for items that don't get delivered. They also have a wide range to select from & delivery is always on time. I'm giving it one star less as in one of my orders, they delivered ginger instead of garlic & I ended up paying for the garlic which was more, however didn't get a refund of the difference until 21 days later.",4,1
Excellent ways of shopping online,4,0
Great app for groceries & vegetables,4,0
"Great App to buy groceries and price are very reasonable even BB Popular and BB Royal (In Brands) are way better quality than any grocery's stores near me. I would have given 5 stars but I didn't because the biscuits quality is mostly crushed almost 40% will be Powdered and the vegetables almost 20% either be dry or it would be ready to go bad in few days. Dals, Rice, Flour's - 9/10, Vegetables & Fruits - 7/10, Biscuit's - 5/10 and other all products mostly they are great so 8/10. Overall 8/10.",4,1

"I had installed this app when the lockdown started. It's been two months everytime I open the App I see the pop up ""all Slot full"" haven't been able to order anything till now. I am thankful to my nearby 8x8 grocery store who made all essentials available during the difficult times, I will continue to buy stuff from him.. Uninstalling the app bye bye bigbasket. Rated 4 start bcoz I understand the situation is not normal.",4,12
"Hi BB Team, Excellent service during COVID-19 situation, I appreciate your efforts during difficult time. I shifted to new address recently. Today when I was checking my past orders I noticed that all my past order's address got updated with the new one. From first look it seems like in the order history, address is not being saved in the database instead your developers are displaying the recent address by simply fetching it from the database. I hope this helps to improve the app :)",4,0
User friendly app and lot of options city-wise,4,0
"Great I am holding BB Star Membership. it's taking much time to allocate the priority slots. If I start proceed the cart items today then finding the slot itself taking two days. There after delievary is taking another 2-3 days. Also, even high speed broadband - The app is working slow to pick the availble itens. If these are Satisfied then I will give 5 star rating to this app.",4,2
"Price slightly high from the market,but satisfactory part is they deliver very carefully every order.i liked it.",4,0
Nice but still some items are out of stock,4,0
Excellent App. Only thing increase the product line in vegetables and fruits. It means almost everything should be available.,4,1
Easy to use app but service need to be improved. Sometimes irritates when they unable to deliver few products with prepaid orders. Stocks should be checked before taking the order.,4,0
"If Big basket is overwhelmed with orders, at least come up with a token system so there is at least some transparency. We were very happy to see BB operational again. But it's of no use because all the slots are always full and we don't know when will they be available again",4,0
"Nice experience, very cooperative.",4,0
Only one time it did not deliver the right order. Otherwise it is a very good app,4,0
"There are a couple of problems I'd like u to address:- 1) any item which is out of stock should be labelled as such in the store itself and not after we checkout. It gets irritating coz one spends a decent amount of time adding stuff, only to find out later that the product isnt available. 2) even after placing an order I received a message just a few hours before delivery that few products can't be delivered. This happened on both occasions and is unacceptable.",4,0

"During th lockdown, Big Basket has been of great help for me and my family in Bangalore. So good job Big Basket Team. The only thing that I noticed in the negative front (that's why four star) is that you keep increasing MRPs of items that don't really change that quickly. For example - I have bought the same eggs for 6,7,8 and 9 rupees in less than one month.",4,3
The app and service are very good but one major problm I encountered was in case the main phone number is switched off or not reachable due to any reason then there should be a section for alternate number to reach out because the efforts of delivery person goes in vain in such times and the order gets cancelled n rescheduled and hussle increases.,4,0
I find the application user friendly.Very easy to place order and to see the instant status of order. I want one more thing to be elaborated. The details of bb wallet used is not clear if some body want to check at later stage. The details are not recorded.Thanks.,4,0
"Updated review: now app is working as expected. Quality of fruits and vegetables and other grocery items are good. As more people are trying to order during this lockdown, you should have pateince of trying to checkout whenever its shows slots availabilty at home page.",4,0
"This app doesn't have coordination with messaging and availablity of delivery slot. Message says stock arrived, then slot not available. When slot becomes available, product goes out of stock. The order is accepted but not delivered as order accepting module has no coordination with inventory stock . Hope this feedback will be useful to improve.",4,0
My experience about this aap is all over good.. All kind of flowers should be available and if it is possible moringa leaves(drumstick leaves) should be available on the site. It is very healthy and helps in growth immunity,4,0
Varieties of products but I think its little bit expensive than others...,4,0
Very prompt service. Easily returned without any hassle. Sometimes part of the vegetables are found in damaged condition. There should be a way to take care of. Prices are quite reasonable and generally lower than other players. .,4,2

good app. Nice interface and easy to use. Only thing missing is a Sodexo payment option like Zeta maybe.,4,0
"Easy to use, but there is no option to say No to express delivery. Despite choosing a delayed delivery, Rs.50 was charged.",4,0
It's a very good app for door step delivery.. Although during crisis they were lacking behind but still managed to impress with the order fulfillment capacity..they need improvement only on the check out section it is a bit clumsy and leads to confusion for customers.. overall a good experience..,4,2
Definitely one of the best Home delivery apps during Lockdown. Recommended app to download. User has to be patient with time slots availability (so kindly keep checking intermittently).... Intimate via missed call or notifications for time slot availability (Suggestion),4,0
I like the app it's good but sometimes if some items are not there they just increase the weight of some products and increase the amount and give some money back to bb wallet but I don't like that if item is not there just refund the money of that and the other products should remain the same. Thanks,4,0
"Feature request: please add a feature to share or export the order details/ items of the order. Go to order - View order details - top right three dots click - no option to export or share order details only payment details export is available. Actual use case: mostly I order groceries from big basket for home, and I'm not there to tally items from the app so I would like to share a copy or items in order to someone at home who will be present while receiving the order.",4,0
Quite useful now during covid times.,4,0
"Nice and user friendly app. Only disappointment is that few products will be displayed as available and don't get delivered in the end. Money gets refunded with 0% hazzle, but would be bad surprise if you have any plans.",4,0
"Many a times it shows the product is notified as available, but by the time I go to confirm the order it shows as unavailable. Some method should be adopted to freeze the item in basket for some time at least next slot opens, and intimation given that slot is available.",4,0
"The delivery has significantly improved since the lockdown was imposed(cheers). The quality of vegetables and other products is highly appreciated.Neatly packed.But i have constantly faced problems with availability of slots.The app lags behind with the actual delivery time. The products were delivered to me early in the morning but in the app it kept saying the delivery was due, because of which i apparently couldn't place the next order since the items ran out of stock the last time.",4,1
Satisfied. I have been using this app for past several years. Big basket had always been prompt on delivery and if any items were not delivered they would provide the credit right away. Issues resolved most promptly. People who have been giving bad reviews please understand the tremendous increase in number of households who have now moved to online grocery purchases. Supply chains take time to set up specially when the demand has increased so fast and so vastly. Please appreciate their efforts.,4,0
Really nice experience but some vegetables when really needed have been out of stock always.,4,0
Fast on navigations for purchases!,4,0
"When placing the order and making online payment the product is reflected in the purchase but prior to delivery 3 or 4 products are not available /delivered which has become a benchmark of BIG BASKET, quite shocking.",4,0
Big Basket has been a major source of sustenance for us. It's the only app that has delivered it's promise during this lock down. I am extremely happy using the app and ordering from BB. All the products are great and are delivered on time. Great job Team BB. Please don't change.,4,0
"App is pretty cool. But, some items are shown as ""available"" but when you put into the basket and check out it's says ""selected items are not available"" instead why don't you say that in the beginning itself.",4,0
"The app is really good and the customer service it on point!! appreciate their on time delivery always. One thing you need to work on is the cost of the fruits and vegetables, few of them are 3X higher than the market price. A one star less for that.",4,0
very useful app. I really love it. sometimes it gets really slow. otherwise absolutely fantastic. If you add dishwasher detergent and Rinse aid. Id like to give 5 stars.,4,0

The experience was really good but I would like to suggest that please add the facility to alter the list for a reasonable amount of time after placing the order so that we can update it in case we miss anything.,4,0
"I m satisfied with your service even though availability of slots is inconvenient but we can understand in this crucial time giving service is more tough. My concern is only that, when product is available then facing a problem with slot and when slot is available then product is out of stock. Can you do not freeze the product when its available for delivery.",4,0
The delivery times and cancellation options needs little more fixing. Otherwise its a good app!,4,0

Decent experience... Few items are shown avl but can't be added to the basket or have to be removed from the basket even if you're checking out immediately... Maybe due to lockdown... But overall good,4,0
"It is very helpful if you can provide filter to remove out of stock items., It's taking too much time to find alternate items in sort window.",4,0
A great UI and app. Please enable online payment through Sodexo. It's a contactless method through the card or zapp pay. It need not be disabled since we can pay for items online like on other sites. Taking off a star since I can't use my Sodexo balance for groceries! Not done!,4,2

problem is avaibility of slots... and also vegetables and fruits are not packed in one packed they are seprate for eg tomatoes were in a net . which sgould be in a paper or plastic pack for prevention of any virus.,4,0

"I like big basket and its service but it doesn't have option to pay by Sodexo (meal card) online. Because of lockdown they don't accept cod, so literally I can't use Sodexo for groceries with this app whereas other groceries delivery app(like grofers) do accept Sodexo online for food items. Also need to improve the quality of fruit and veggies for delivery.",4,0

It was good. I was expecting that once order is booked then there should be option to add or delete items till a specified period.,4,0
In normal days your service is the best but in today's situation not when it is more necessary. Most of the time when we checkout some products gets disable due to out of stock. Instead of automatically putting them in basketball for next available stock they are totally removed. Again we have to remember and add them in basketball. Again the same thing happens. Meanwhile we search for the products the slots gets full. Though we have time in these days not that much to waste.,4,0

"Very good app. Pretty easy to use. Although, there are a couple of things that i feel could make this much better. 1. It would be nice to be able to create lists of products that i could use as reference because most of the items i order each week tend to be from the same pool of products. 2. Often there are multiple family members or roommates wanting to update the shopping list.

Generally very good particularly as we are senior citizens. Deliveries are punctual and the boys are pleasant. The produce is fresh and good quality. The main complaint I have is the plastic crates in which stuff is brought to our door are very filthy. Considering they are handling food I would have expected that they are steam cleaned every day. Steam also works as sanitizer which in these Covid days is something BB should seriously look into. If they improve I can easily give 5 stars.,4,0

shud confirm order post payment.... like Spencer's. also cancelled order amt shud go to CRedit Card instead of wallet... also cash back shud be within a week... not 90 days.

i am prime member . and you are cheating us . if we order and item are not available then you should credit that amount directly into customers bank account. not bb wallet. this is your strategy to make costomer buy to redeem but you again do the same our next order. if you can not deliver item then credit my amount in my bank account. else . this is last . and you will lose trust.,4,0

Good app compared with any other online grocerystores. But my suggestion is that to make it free delivery so that many people use this app as some are leaving this because of high delivery charges for limited amount . If there are no delivery charges this app is awesome with some positives like :- # fast delivery i.e within 1 or 2 days. # delivery slot bookings according to our convenience . # good offers on bb products. ***Only negative other than some products high cost is delivery charges .,4,49

Once an order is on the way, it will be great if you develop the feature of live gps tracking of the delivery boy so that customer knows exactly where the driver is and when he will be arriving. Otherwise as per bb policy, within 1 or 2 hour slot anytime if the driver comes then he waits maximum 2-5mins and leaves and a customer can be busy in that 2mins in an hour slot. This feature will help the client as well as delivery process.",4,0

Remarkable app .Extremely satisfied with your services . Very efficient delivery executives .Kindly make more products available .Thank you for making shopping smooth and easy experience with quality products and services .,5,6
"App is user friendly and products are reasonably priced. BB has plenty of variety in every category. Small & less moving items are also available @ any given time, Otherwise you are informed whenever it gets available. Delivery is always on time. One big improvement is required regarding quality of fruits and vegetables. These items being perishable, reqd to be supplied in fresh state. Or otherwise they start rotting & decaying. Such inadvertent supply to customers should strictly be monitored",5,0
It's Really a great app with wide range of products. And the products are delivered on time. Well done!,5,0
"Very good app, I am so happy that I can view all items of different brands. Now I can choose what I want. And delivery is very good and on time. Thanks 😊🤩.",5,3
"hangs a lot but it works fine, and delivers everything you order too. the discounts are good and if you look for them you can get good deals too. every now there is some shortage such as you won't find your favourite food item but there is mostly replacements available so those work fine too. all in all I get most of my food (other than what i buy in person) from here. they're on time too, and the delivery boys make sure to check with you before leaving without fulfilling your order.",5,34
"Availability, prices and ordering process very convenient. Neat interface, several payment options too, thanks",5,0
Awesome app and very easy to use. Most of needed products are available.,5,1

"This app has proved to be very useful, especially in the recent times. Vegetables and fruits are fresh and overall delivery is always on time.",5,0
"The service is excellent! The app has a little bit of lag issues, but nothing major",5,0
A life saver during lockdown and now these troubled times. Great range and selection and pretty quick turnaround times. Sometimes the veggies and fruits are a little below expectations but the no questions asked refund more than makes up for it. One gripe is that they dont pack it like grofers which makes handling easy since our apartment doesn't permit entry into homes right now so we have to pick it up. But then their range is nowhere near yours so not complaining too much.,5,0
"Great product , Very fast delivery, Good healthy vegies and fruits. Request to add more seasonal / local vegetables and fruits.",5,0
A good token system introduced. Now u can order your items and know when it will be delivered.,5,5
"While I love this app and the service provided, I have a suggestion to make. It would be really helpful if you could bring the facility to make payments using Sodexo card in a similar fashion like that of other cards instead of the current method of sharing a link and all... The customer can add the card details like card number, expiry etc and can transact using the Sodexo card pin... It will be more user friendly and very convinient.",5,20
It is a very good app to purchase the goods. I have faced one problem that is available the delivery slot. Maximum time it was seen all slots are full. Kindly Order other time or day. Please resolve the issue as early as possible. So that we can purchase more items in this app. Apart from that all are very good. Thanks bigbasket.,5,32
Great Experience of Shopping with bigbasket. Recently allowing to pay though Sodexo Meal Card that is really helpful and it's a great step of bigbasket for customers.,5,3
I love this app . It allows you to choose what time you want it to get delivered. It also has fresh product .,5,0
I am using this app since last 2 year. It is very good app and also it's custome care services is awesome. They solve my query within a time. Seriously I am very big fan of this app. They give good discount. As per comments they are providing good service and offer.,5,2

"Please add online payment option for meal card and I will give 5 🌟. Update 30 Aug : I just did online payment using meal card, as promised rating updated to 5🌟",5,0
"Items are getting removed automatically from my cart long after placing the order stating that they are out of stock. I thought items will be reserved as soon as they are placed. I can't keep placing the same order multiple times. Really dissatisfied Edit: After a bad experience, my recent order was delivered promptly without any issues. The delivery executive also made sure I collected my order. Thank you!",5,4
"Good app in search of products, just found that the order success page doesn't get forwarded at once payment success. We needed to press back button",5,2
"Menu of items in any day is best compared of all other online grocery portals I used and their delivery commitment is just great! Cons: Order confirmation happens before successful, this sometimes create problem when payment fails, create problems. It would be good if BB app confirms the order only after successful payment similar to other online apps.",5,10
Great app indeed 👍. I liked the experience of shopping with big basket.,5,0
Super app. Easy to order and delivery next day or other day,5,0
Best app for groceries. Best prices available for veggies and fruits too. I was simply amazed at having seen even notebook and Duracell batteries as available here. That really means a lot. Thanks BB for giving me a choice.,5,1
"Very User friendly. However, during lockdown I noticed that even orders were not getting placed due to slot unavailability. There could have been an option to place order with a maximum delivery time, say 1 week or so. Local vendors definitely were life saver during that time. One issue which may be resolved is when we cannot collect the order delivery, items are left open at the informed place. Those items can be kept inside boxes to avoid missing it as BB does not take responsibility.",5,15
Awesome app. My go-to app for groceries. Easy-to-use to use and easy returns policy. Can add item later too when items available if order is already placed in the same time slot.,5,1
We started using BB during this lockdown and now this has become our go-to app for any grocery. The delivery personnel are polite and respectful. They are very helpful too. The customer service is prompt and any issue gets resolved almost immediately. We have become loyal customers to BB. You guys are doing a great job!,5,0
Quite hasslefree and convenient. Would recommend loyalty discount offers for frequent buyers like me.,5,0
"Good App. Almost everything related to grocery is available here.. just that the products should be delivered in some bag or carton, it comes all loose in the crate. Thats only the problem, otherwise is very nice",5,0
Their customer service is amazing . If U have an issue they will be available anytym easily and the issue is resolved . No stress at all,5,0
"Great experience. 1 improvement though, I live in Faridabad -Haryana and the app doesn't have the option to add the city, even with location it auto picks Gurgaon. Perhaps you may want to have the same corrected. I'm getting my orders timely and with good service, invoice somehow and system is reading and detecting Gurgaon city inadvertently. 5 star app and 10 star service.👌",5,1
I have been using this app for a few months and it works very well. You can order a plethora of things and the service is spot on: always on time and as expected. I did have trouble with the first couple of orders I placed in that they were not able to deliver everything that was ordered. I have had no problems since and even have been able to decline items from the order I didn't need anymore. A very performant and useful app!,5,4
"The service is good, initially i had trouble with delivery on time and confusion. after better communicating with bb, order is remarkably lesser compared to supermarkets. I prefer bb since its very convenient. During lockdown, I could only rely on BB for my daily groceries. BB has everything including imported products such as cheese, blueberries, gourmet breads. For baking, some items are amis. And the staff are very pleasant and helpful.",5,4
"Good app. Service is good. Now a days, if vegetables and fruits are not good they take it back at the time of delivery only.",5,0
Easy to use app. But best feature is the product range & delivery time.. mostly Next day,5,0

"Buy almost everything vegs, fruits, soft drinks, etc from the comfort of your home. BB app is very user friendly - Ordering or replacement just tick the item you need to change and get refund & it's done. And above all get nice offers from time to time. On the other hand JIOMART they are pathetic. First of all they supply bad, rotten and damaged items and then getting things sorted out is very difficult. 50% chance is to loose. And lots of botheration.",5,8
Good range of items available at a relatively cheaper price,5,0
Very useful for people with shift duties and esp during the pandemic. The quality of products are also very good.,5,0

Wish other portals too respond similarly. However, please work on availability of items as many items are out of stock most of the time nowadays.",5,2

Great app. Having all required groceries. Value for money. They refund money immediately for bad and returned goods. Will get notification when item would be available. Best price as compared to other apps. Hygiene followed in packing and during lockdown period. Great fan of this app using past 2 years. Items which are not available in any other app are available in a bigbasket.,5,18
I think it is a best app for online shopping because we are unable to go out of the house due to covid-19 you can not only by veg things but you can also buy non veg if you are looking for an online grocery shopping app is the best and perfectly made for you😀😀😃😃. But the problem is not problem that you can't get the slots easily I think they should fix this problem to make the app best and better than grofers,5,3
Big basket's service is outstanding.,5,0
"During this lockdown, i started using big basket. And i really felt too good. It may show slots unavailable during this situation. But if you check regularly you may find slots.

However i still would like to give you guys 5 stars for somehow making efforts to pull it through. Good luck !,5,1
"The app layout is good and quite easy to browse through, however, few improvement points are there like. 1. When we add or delete item, the total value is not getting updated automatically. 2. Though available time slots are shown on the front page, while placing order, lapsed time slot is offered automatically. Rest as of now looks wonderful.",5,37

Bigbasket is doing a great job during the lockdown. Items are not very expensive especially vebetables . ( Fruits price can be brought down though). Slots aren't available easily and all items are not available every time but I understand it's because of the surge in purchases. Thank you and God bless each and every member working in the Bigbasket Team!!!,5,3

Very easy to use n prompt delivery,5,0
"When purchased items are reserved and the buyer paid for that, why some or one item is short delivered.

Wide variety of merchandise. Timely delivery. Fruits & vegetables are fresh and of best quality. Fully satisfied with the service. App is very easy to order goods.,5,1
"Good app being easy to use & equally prompt & courteous responses. Due to the unprecedented lock down in the country, there are delays which is understandable. One area of innovation would be to give us the date available for delivery to us by sms/mail. Would save us time to check your app everytime to find the open slot for delivery.",5,1

"Its bit challenging to get a slot, but service is at it's best.. Thank you for your service during this pandemic situation..",5,0
Been using this app during the lockdown phase as I live in one of the contamination zones. I must say the folks at big basket have ensured I get my essentials as well as other items on time which is super job in the times we live in. Would recommend it over any of the other apps including Grofer's. Even though slots are limited the number of times they open slots for delivery is much higher than other apps. Thank you to the folks at Big basket.,5,3
"Very useful, especially under the current situation. Inserting the address is a problem, because of the lack of editing facility. This needs to be improved.",5,0

My experience was good with bigbasket . But one thing do care about things we order. Deliver boys just throw the packages down .like ice-cream cake was kept deep down and he throwed it on road to open from his bag in which cake was packed. Other than that everything is good,5,0
Nice experience,5,0
"Delivery is smooth. Feel thankful for deliveries during pendamic. Few suggestions, as corona is spreadup and we can't keep vegies with their packets or cartons boxes, I feel it's unnecessary to get products in such packages rather all the veggies can be delivered directly just in 1 bag. It will save packaging cost and timings.",5,0

Small & less moving items are also available @ any given time, Otherwise you are informed whenever it gets available. Delivery is always on time. One big improvement is required regarding quality of fruits and vegetables. These items being perishable, reqd to be supplied in fresh state. Or otherwise they start rotting & decaying.

"Hi team. I am not writing just because am sitting idle to begin with. Honestly I have used big basket for only about a year now and I genuinely would like to appreciate your team effort. Customer care guy calls in case of any issue, priorities can be set, especially the delivery people are so polite and professional. And am saying this with experience in delhi and Bangalore. In my opinion no other I repeat no other business has such good and efficient delivery people. It's not swiggy not Amazon.",5,0
